  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {A key question for connectomics is how topological properties of brain graphs relate to the signaling and information processing functions of nervous systems. Three models of neural information flow are considered in the chapter: shortest path routing, diffusion, and navigation. These models are explained with intuitive metaphors. The efficiency with which information can be communicated under these models is quantified with various measures of network integration. Shortest path routing is the most commonly studied model, and is fundamental to the concept of the brain as a small-world network. Shortest path routing assumes that neurons communicate with well-defined destinations in mind, and that the shortest path to these destinations is known globally. These may be unrealistic assumptions in nervous systems, motivating the study of alternative models of neural information flow that does not mandate centralized, homunculus-like control. Diffusion processes imply that the flow of information is much like the flow of fluids in a network of pipes, which propagates simultaneously along multiple `fronts', without being directed toward a single destination. Communicability is the simplest measure quantifying the efficiency with which information can be communicated under this model. Another model is navigation, where each node forwards information to its closest neighbour in physical distance to the desired destination. Navigation performs particularly well in spatially-embedded, scale-free networks like the brain. We discuss the pros and cons of all three models of neural information flow, and show how they have been applied in order to understand the organization of connectomes at various scales. This chapter also introduces readers to a random walker, the Laplacian matrix and the concept of a network morphospace.},

Here, we present a suite of technologies to use optogenetics effectively in primates and apply these tools to a classic question in oculomotor control. First, we measured light absorption and heat propagation in vivo, optimized the conditions for using the red-light-shifted halorhodopsin Jaws in primates, and developed a large-volume illuminator to maximize light delivery with minimal heating and tissue displacement. Together, these advances allowed for nearly universal neuronal inactivation across more than 10 mm(3) of the cortex. Using these tools, we demonstrated large behavioral changes (i.e., up to several fold increases in error rate) with relatively low light power densities ({$\leq$}100 mW/mm(2)) in the frontal eye field (FEF). Pharmacological inactivation studies have shown that the FEF is critical for executing saccades to remembered locations. FEF neurons increase their firing rate during the three epochs of the memory-guided saccade task: visual stimulus presentation, the delay interval, and motor preparation. It is unclear from earlier work, however, whether FEF activity during each epoch is necessary for memory-guided saccade execution. By harnessing the temporal specificity of optogenetics, we found that FEF contributes to memory-guided eye movements during every epoch of the memory-guided saccade task (the visual, delay, and motor periods).},

EEG was recorded from 18 sites (10-20 system). A new dynamical measure, mutual dimension (Dm) was applied to the EEG. The Dm was calculated between each electrode paired to all other electrodes. The results were compared to coherence measures. Differential patterns of significant changes of Dm estimates were found in the two emotional conditions. When compared to the neutral viewing condition, the emotionally negative experience provoked significant decreases of short- and long-distance ipsi- and contralateral Dm estimates that were more left-sided (with a 'center of gravity' of Dm decrease at the F7 site), whereas the emotionally positive experience showed a pattern of symmetrically distributed ipsi- and contralateral increases of Dm estimates over central and posterior cortical regions (with 'main processing nodes' of Dm increases at T5 and T6 sites). It is concluded that estimates of the mutual dimension are sensitive to subtle aspects of emotional processing, not accessible by linear (i.e. coherence) analyses.},

An analysis of covariance (AnCova) model was constructed with a statistical threshold of p{$<$}0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons. After controlling for age and severity of illness, results showed significant gray matter density reduction in left superior temporal lobe (p=0.03) and left orbitofrontal cortex (p=0.04) in patients who had attempted suicide when comparing with non-suicidal patients. Although sample size limitations and potential clinical heterogeneity preclude definitive conclusions, these data point to structural differences in key cerebral areas. Neuroimaging studies are necessary to expand our knowledge of biological mechanisms underlying suicide in schizophrenia.},

Here we use two-photon calcium imaging to record the activity of large populations of neurons at the cellular level, throughout the brain of larval zebrafish expressing a genetically encoded calcium sensor, while the paralysed animals interact fictively with a virtual environment and rapidly adapt their motor output to changes in visual feedback. We decompose the network dynamics involved in adaptive locomotion into four types of neuronal response properties, and provide anatomical maps of the corresponding sites. A subset of these signals occurred during behavioural adjustments and are candidates for the functional elements that drive motor learning. Lesions to the inferior olive indicate a specific functional role for olivocerebellar circuitry in adaptive locomotion. This study enables the analysis of brain-wide dynamics at single-cell resolution during behaviour.},

Here we use light-sheet microscopy to record activity, reported through the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP5G, from the entire volume of the brain of the larval zebrafish in vivo at 0.8 Hz, capturing more than 80\% of all neurons at single-cell resolution. Demonstrating how this technique can be used to reveal functionally defined circuits across the brain, we identify two populations of neurons with correlated activity patterns. One circuit consists of hindbrain neurons functionally coupled to spinal cord neuropil. The other consists of an anatomically symmetric population in the anterior hindbrain, with activity in the left and right halves oscillating in antiphase, on a timescale of 20 s, and coupled to equally slow oscillations in the inferior olive.},

  abstract = {Exposure to early stressful adverse life events may increase vulnerability to psychopathology in adult life. There are important memory disturbances in stress-related psychiatric disorders. Therefore, there is much interest in understanding the mechanisms responsible for interactions between stress and cognition. Male Wistar rats that experienced 3-h daily separations from the dam during the first 3 weeks of life (maternal separation, MS) showed in adulthood a depressive-like behaviour in the forced swimming test, increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responsiveness to stressors and elevated CRF mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). In the hippocampus of MS rats, there was a lower glucocorticoid receptor density. MS produced significant learning impairments both in the Morris water maze and in the novel object recognition test (NORT). The glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol were able to completely reverse the increased immobility time in the forced swimming test and the memory deficits in the NORT observed in MS rats. Our data support the hypothesis that elevated secretion of glucocorticoids may be associated to behavioural and cognitive deficits in MS rats. The stress hyperresponsiveness observed in MS rats could be attributed, at least in part, to an impaired feedback sensitivity mediated by hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors. It can also be suggested the possible involvement of the noradrenergic system in cognitive impairments mediated by glucocorticoids in the MS model.},

  abstract = {Soil bulk density ( {$\rho$}b) measurement is essential for many soil management and engineering applications in addition to the emerging need to estimate soil carbon reserves. Recently, pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been gaining widespread recognition for their capability to predict soil bulk density using extractable soil available databases. However, these functions are site specific and might be hampered when used in different environments. The objective of this study is to develop and compare PTFs for estimating soil {$\rho$}b in an arid environment from texture fractions and soil organic carbon (SOC). The examined PTFs were simple linear regression (SLR), multiple non-linear regression (NLR), stepwise multiple linear regression (SWR), partial least squares (PLS), and artificial neural networks (ANNs). A large data set of soil samples procured from the Amman-Zarqa basin, a typical arid environment in north Jordan, were used to calibrate and validate the PTFs. Soil organic carbon and sand contents had moderate correlations with soil {$\rho$}b, and both were almost interchangeable predictors of soil {$\rho$}b. Moreover, it has been found that increasing the number of predictor variables in the PTF models enhanced the prediction capabilities of soil {$\rho$}b. Furthermore, ANNs had high capabilities in predicting soil {$\rho$}b. As compared to SLR models, the ANNs were 57.5\% less unbiased, 85\% less precise, and 18.4\% more accurate in predicting soil {$\rho$}b in arid environments. \textcopyright{} 2013 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.},

  abstract = {Molecular systems biology aims to describe the functions of complex biological processes through recursive integration of molecular analysis, modeling, simulation and theory. It focuses on networks that originate from interconnection of genes, proteins and metabolites whose dynamic interactions generate, as an emergent property of the system, the corresponding function. Although evolutionary optimized, intracellular biochemical parameters, such as the expression level of gene products or the affinity between two or more proteins, must have a permissible range that gives robustness against perturbations to the system. Using the yeast G1-to-S transition network as an example we show that sophisticated relations exist among network structure, emergent property and robustness. Different emergent properties are generated from the same network by changing the strength of its interactions, not only by altering expression level, but also through mono and multi-site phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Besides, multi-site protein phosphorylation modules, widespread in cell cycle, may ensure robust and coherent timing of cell cycle transitions as it happens for the onset of DNA replication. In conclusion, the modulation of biological function/emergent property by modifying interaction strength provides an efficient, highly tunable device to regulate biological processes. Furthermore, the principles outlined herein may provide new insight to network analysis in drug discovery. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In our view, structure is the totality of relationships among a system's components, and these relationships can be quantified using information theory. In the interest of flexibility we allow information to be quantified using any function, including Shannon entropy and Kolmogorov complexity, that satisfies certain fundamental axioms. Using these axioms, we formalize the notion of a dependency among components, and show how a system's structure is revealed in the amount of information assigned to each dependency. We explore quantitative indices that summarize system structure, providing a new formal basis for the complexity profile and introducing a new index, the "marginal utility of information". Using simple examples, we show how these indices capture intuitive ideas about structure in a quantitative way. Our formalism also sheds light on a longstanding mystery: that the mutual information of three or more variables can be negative. We discuss applications to complex networks, gene regulation, the kinetic theory of fluids and multiscale cybernetic thermodynamics.},

  abstract = {Entropy appears in many contexts (thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, information theory, measure-preserving dynamical systems, topological dynamics, etc.) as a measure of different properties (energy that cannot produce work, disorder, uncertainty, randomness, complexity, etc.). In this review, we focus on the so-called generalized entropies, which from a mathematical point of view are nonnegative functions defined on probability distributions that satisfy the first three Shannon-Khinchin axioms: continuity, maximality and expansibility. While these three axioms are expected to be satisfied by all macroscopic physical systems, the fourth axiom (separability or strong additivity) is in general violated by non-ergodic systems with long range forces, this having been the main reason for exploring weaker axiomatic settings. Currently, non-additive generalized entropies are being used also to study new phenomena in complex dynamics (multifractality), quantum systems (entanglement), soft sciences, and more. Besides going through the axiomatic framework, we review the characterization of generalized entropies via two scaling exponents introduced by Hanel and Thurner. In turn, the first of these exponents is related to the diffusion scaling exponent of diffusion processes, as we also discuss. Applications are addressed as the description of the main generalized entropies advances.},

  abstract = {The use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an important treatment option for movement disorders and other medical conditions. Today, three major manufacturers provide implantable systems for DBS. Although the underlying principle is basically the same for all available systems, the differences in the technical features vary considerably. This article outlines aspects regarding the technical features of DBS systems. The differences between voltage and current sources are addressed and their effect on stimulation is shown. To maintain clinical benefit and minimize side effects the stimulation field has to be adapted to the requirements of the patient. Shaping of the stimula-tion field can be achieved by the electrode design and polarity configuration. Furthermore, the electric signal consisting of stimulation rate, stimulation amplitude and pulse width affect the stimulation field. Interleaving stim-ulation is an additional concept, which permits improved treatment outcomes. Therefore, the electrode design, the polarity, the electric signal, and the concept of interleaving stimulation are presented. The investigated systems can be also categorized as rechargeable and non-rechargeable, which is briefly discussed. Options for interconnecting different system components from various manufacturers are presented. The present paper summarizes the technical features and their combination possibilities, which can have a major impact on the therapeutic effect.},

Our analysis is inspired by a realistic experiment where one stimulates externally specific parts of the brain and studies the persistent neural activity triggered in other cortical regions. In this work, we perturb groups of neurons that form communities, identified by the walktrap community detection method, by trains of stereotypical electrical Poissonian impulses and study the propagation of neural activity to other communities by measur-ing the corresponding dynamic ranges and Steven law exponents. We show that when one perturbs specific communities, keeping the rest unperturbed, the external stimulations are able to propagate to some of them but not to all. There are also perturbations that do not trigger any response. We found that this depends on the initially perturbed community. Finally, we relate our findings for the former cases with low neural syn-chronization, self-criticality and large information flow capacity, and interpret them as the ability of the brain network to respond to external perturbations when it works at criticality and its information flow capacity becomes maximal. One of the fundamental findings in neuroscience is the modular organization of the brain, which in turn points to an inherent parallel nature of brain computations. Cortical networks are hier-archical and clustered with complex connectiv-ity patterns. Modular processors have to be suf-ficiently isolated and dynamically differentiated to achieve independent computations, but also globally connected to be integrated in coherent functions. One of the oldest problems in psy-chophysics is the relation between external stim-ulus and neural response in such brains. This is a nonlinear relation as a linear one would lead to an unbounded neural response, not observed in real sensorial organs and, can be quantified by means of the dynamic range theory. In this pa-per, we explore the effect of the application of external electrical stimuli, modelled by Poisson processes of fixed average input rates, to specific communities of the brain dynamical network of the Caenorhabditis elegans soil worm, and study external perturbations spreading to the rest by measuring the dynamic ranges and Steven law ex-ponents. Our work is inspired by a realistic ex-periment where one stimulates externally specific cortical regions and studies the persistent neu-ral activity triggered in other regions. We show that when particular communities are perturbed, keeping the rest unperturbed, the external stim-ulations propagate to some but not all of them.

  abstract = {Neural interface technology has made enormous strides in recent years but stimulating electrodes remain incapable of reliably targeting specific cell types (e.g. excitatory or inhibitory neurons) within neural tissue. This obstacle has major scientific and clinical implications. For example, there is intense debate among physicians, neuroengineers and neuroscientists regarding the relevant cell types recruited during deep brain stimulation (DBS); moreover, many debilitating side effects of DBS likely result from lack of cell-type specificity. We describe here a novel optical neural interface technology that will allow neuroengineers to optically address specific cell types in vivo with millisecond temporal precision. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), an algal light-activated ion channel we developed for use in mammals, can give rise to safe, light-driven stimulation of CNS neurons on a timescale of milliseconds. Because ChR2 is genetically targetable, specific populations of neurons even sparsely embedded within intact circuitry can be stimulated with high temporal precision. Here we report the first in vivo behavioral demonstration of a functional optical neural interface (ONI) in intact animals, involving integrated fiberoptic and optogenetic technology. We developed a solid-state laser diode system that can be pulsed with millisecond precision, outputs 20 mW of power at 473 nm, and is coupled to a lightweight, flexible multimode optical fiber, approximately 200 microm in diameter. To capitalize on the unique advantages of this system, we specifically targeted ChR2 to excitatory cells in vivo with the CaMKIIalpha promoter. Under these conditions, the intensity of light exiting the fiber ( approximately 380 mW mm(-2)) was sufficient to drive excitatory neurons in vivo and control motor cortex function with behavioral output in intact rodents. No exogenous chemical cofactor was needed at any point, a crucial finding for in vivo work in large mammals. Achieving modulation of behavior with optical control of neuronal subtypes may give rise to fundamental network-level insights complementary to what electrode methodologies have taught us, and the emerging optogenetic toolkit may find application across a broad range of neuroscience, neuroengineering and clinical questions.},

  abstract = {We have studied the effects of the proteolytic enzyme Pronase on the membrane currents of voltage-clamped squid axons. Internal perfusion of the axons with Pronase rather selectively destroys inactivation of the Na conductance (g(Na)). At the level of a single channel, Pronase probably acts in an all-or-none manner: each channel inactivates normally until its inactivation gate is destroyed, and then it no longer inactivates. Pronase reduces g(Na), possibly by destroying some of the channels, but after removal of its inactivation gate a Na channel seems no longer vulnerable to Pronase. The turn-off kinetics and the voltage dependence of the Na channel activation gates are not affected by Pronase, and it is probable that the enzyme does not affect these gates in any way. Neither the K channels nor their activation gates are affected in a specific way by Pronase. Tetrodotoxin does not protect the inactivation gates from Pronase, nor does maintained inactivation of the Na channels during exposure to Pronase. Our results suggest that the inactivation gate is a readily accessible protein attached to the inner end of each Na channel. It is shown clearly that activation and inactivation of Na channels are separable processes, and that Na channels are distinct from K channels.},

In many cases rhythmic patterns of activity are the result of the cooperation between groups of small number of neurons bearing overall network dynamics. These patterns encode information in different spatio-temporal scales based on the history-dependent capabilities of neuronal dynamics. In this work we analyze a simple neural network, a Central Pattern Generator, by identifying and characterizing the dynamical patterns sustaining the coordination among the constituent neurons. The description of the corresponding coordination states is performed with the guidance of the theory of applied symbolic dynamics. We show that symbolic dynamics enables the automatic detection of meaningful events with low computational cost, endorsing the analysis of both individual and global neuronal dynamics. Furthermore, symbolic dynamics can be used to compute entropy and distinguish between networks with the same topology but different dynamics for the underlying nodes. The results obtained along the paper are not restricted to simple systems, and the proposed methodology can be applied to the generalization of closed-loop observation and control of complex biological systems. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Franklin Institute.},

According to the commonly accepted view, traces of memory are stored through the structural modifications of synaptic connections, which result in changes of synaptic efficiency and, therefore, in formations of new patterns of neural activity (the hypothesis of synaptic plasticity). Most of the current knowledge on learning and initial stages of memory consolidation ("synaptic consolidation") is based on this hypothesis. However, the hypothesis of synaptic plasticity faces a number of conceptual and experimental difficulties when it deals with potentially permanent consolidation of declarative memory ("system consolidation"). These difficulties are rooted in the major intrinsic self-contradiction of the hypothesis: stable declarative memory is unlikely to be based on such a non-stable foundation as synaptic plasticity. Memory that can last throughout an entire lifespan should be "etched in stone." The only "stone-like" molecules within living cells are DNA molecules. Therefore, I advocate an alternative, genomic hypothesis of memory, which suggests that acquired information is persistently stored within individual neurons through modifications of DNA, and that these modifications serve as the carriers of elementary memory traces.},

  abstract = {Computational Cognitive Neuroscience (CCN) is a new field that lies at the intersection of computational neuroscience, machine learning, and neural network theory (i.e., connectionism). The ideal CCN model should not make any assumptions that are known to contradict the current neuroscience literature and at the same time provide good accounts of behavior and at least some neuroscience data (e.g., single-neuron activity, fMRI data). Furthermore, once set, the architecture of the CCN network and the models of each individual unit should remain fixed throughout all applications. Because of the greater weight they place on biological accuracy, CCN models differ substantially from traditional neural network models in how each individual unit is modeled, how learning is modeled, and how behavior is generated from the network. A variety of CCN solutions to these three problems are described. A real example of this approach is described, and some advantages and limitations of the CCN approach are discussed.},

We tested patients with unilateral HPC resections on a virtual analogue of a classic spatial task to assess HPC functioning in nonhumans: the Morris water task. We found that when humans are required to use spatial cues to navigate to a hidden escape platform in a pool, patients with HPC resections display severe impairments in spatial navigation relative to age-matched controls and age-matched patients who have had extra-HPC resections. This effect occurred for every patient tested and was evident regardless of side of surgery. Hence, it is apparent across species and irrespective of which hemisphere is damaged that the human HPC is critical for spatial/relational memory.},

  abstract = {Despite the removal of the mercury (Hg)-based preservative thimerosal from vaccines listed on the Australian Immunization Program Schedule for children, concerns remain among some researchers and parents for the safety of the present schedule, in part due to a fear of residual trace levels of Hg. The purpose of this study was to independently assess childhood vaccines for the presence of Hg. Eight vaccines administered to children under the age of 5 yr were assessed for Hg content via a DMA-80 direct mercury analyzer. Seven of the 8 vaccines contained no detectable levels of Hg (less than 1 ppb); however, 1 vaccine (Infanrix hexa) tested positive for Hg at 10 ppb. The result was confirmed and validated by retesting the original sample. Follow-up testing was conducted on three additional samples of Infanrix hexa (one from the same production lot and two from a different lot). All three tested positive for Hg (average of 9.7 ppb). Although the levels of Hg detected are substantially lower than any established exposure safety limits, the results of this study reveal that inaccuracies exist in public health messages, professional communications, and official documentation regarding Hg content in at least one childhood vaccine. In the interests of public health, it is incumbent on vaccine manufacturers and responsible agencies such as the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the Federal Department of Health and Ageing to address this issue as a matter of urgency.

In the current study, we used fMRI to measure neural activity in participants solving a visuospatial creativity problem that involves divergent thinking and has been considered a canonical right hemisphere task. As hypothesized, both the visual creativity task and the control task as compared to rest activated a variety of areas including the posterior parietal cortex bilaterally and motor regions, which are known to be involved in visuospatial rotation of objects. However, directly comparing the two tasks indicated that the creative task more strongly activated left hemisphere regions including the posterior parietal cortex, the premotor cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the medial PFC. These results demonstrate that even in a task that is specialized to the right hemisphere, robust parallel activity in the left hemisphere supports creative processing. Furthermore, the results support the notion that higher motor planning may be a general component of creative improvisation and that such goal-directed planning of novel solutions may be organized top-down by the left DLPFC and by working memory processing in the medial prefrontal cortex.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Statistical models, such as linear or logistic regression or survival analysis, are frequently used as a means to answer scientific questions in psychosomatic research. Many who use these techniques, however, apparently fail to appreciate fully the problem of overfitting, ie, capitalizing on the idiosyncrasies of the sample at hand. Overfitted models will fail to replicate in future samples, thus creating considerable uncertainty about the scientific merit of the finding. The present article is a nontechnical discussion of the concept of overfitting and is intended to be accessible to readers with varying levels of statistical expertise. The notion of overfitting is presented in terms of asking too much from the available data. Given a certain number of observations in a data set, there is an upper limit to the complexity of the model that can be derived with any acceptable degree of uncertainty. Complexity arises as a function of the number of degrees of freedom expended (the number of predictors including complex terms such as interactions and nonlinear terms) against the same data set during any stage of the data analysis. Theoretical and empirical evidence--with a special focus on the results of computer simulation studies--is presented to demonstrate the practical consequences of overfitting with respect to scientific inference. Three common practices--automated variable selection, pretesting of candidate predictors, and dichotomization of continuous variables--are shown to pose a considerable risk for spurious findings in models. The dilemma between overfitting and exploring candidate confounders is also discussed. Alternative means of guarding against overfitting are discussed, including variable aggregation and the fixing of coefficients a priori. Techniques that account and correct for complexity, including shrinkage and penalization, also are introduced.},

We recorded from neuronal ensembles in the prefrontal cortex as rats learned a new delayed alternation task. Ensemble activities changed in parallel with behavioral learning so that they increasingly allowed correct decoding of previous and future goal choices. In well-trained rats, considerable decoding was possible based on only a few neurons and after removing continuously active delay cells. These results show that neural activity in the prefrontal cortex changes dynamically during new task learning so that working memory is robustly represented and that working memory can be mediated by sequential activation of different neural populations.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to review the application of complexity science methods in understanding energy systems and system change. The challenge of moving to sustainable energy systems which provide secure, affordable and low-carbon energy services requires the application of methods which recognise the complexity of energy systems in relation to social, technological, economic and environmental aspects. Energy systems consist of many actors, interacting through networks, leading to emergent properties and adaptive and learning processes. Insights on these type of phenomena have been investigated in other contexts by complex systems theory. However, these insights are only recently beginning to be applied to understanding energy systems and systems transitions. The paper discusses the aspects of energy systems (in terms of technologies, ecosystems, users, institutions, business models) that lend themselves to the application of complexity science and its characteristics of emergence and coevolution. Complex-systems modelling differs from standard (e.g. economic) modelling and offers capabilities beyond those of conventional models, yet these methods are only beginning to realize anything like their full potential to address the most critical energy challenges. In particular there is significant potential for progress in understanding those challenges that reside at the interface of technology and behaviour. Some of the computational methods that are currently available are reviewed: agent-based and network modelling. The advantages and limitations of these modelling techniques are discussed.Finally, the paper considers the emerging themes of transport, energy behaviour and physical infrastructure systems in recent research from complex-systems energy modelling. Although complexity science is not well understood by practitioners in the energy domain (and is often difficult to communicate), models can be used to aid decision-making at multiple levels e.g. national and local, and to aid understanding and allow decision making. The techniques and tools of complexity science, therefore, offer a powerful means of understanding the complex decision-making processes that are needed to realise a low-carbon energy system. We conclude with recommendations for future areas of research and application.},

  abstract = {Information about a system's internal interactions is important to modeling the system's dynamics. This study examines the finer categories of the information definition and explores the features of a type of local information that describes the internal interactions of a system. Based on the results, a dual-space agent and information modeling framework (AIM) is developed by explicitly distinguishing an information space from the material space. The two spaces can evolve both independently and interactively. The dual-space framework can provide new analytic methods for agent based models (ABMs).

  abstract = {Information about a system's internal interactions is important to modeling the system's dynamics. This study examines the finer categories of the information definition and explores the features of a type of local information that describes the internal interactions of a system. Based on the results, a dual-space agent and information modeling framework (AIM) is developed by explicitly distinguishing an information space from the material space. The two spaces can evolve both independently and interactively. The dual-space framework can provide new analytic methods for agent based models (ABMs).

One approach, the complexity profile, is a measure of the information to describe a system as a function of the scale at which it is observed. We present a new formulation of the complexity profile, which expands its possible application to high-dimensional real-world and mathematically defined systems. The new method is constructed from the pairwise dependencies between components of the system. The pairwise approach may serve as both a formulation in its own right and a computationally feasible approximation to the original complexity profile. We compare it to the original complexity profile by giving cases where they are equivalent, proving properties common to both methods, and demonstrating where they differ. Both formulations satisfy linear superposition for unrelated systems and conservation of total degrees of freedom (sum rule). The new pairwise formulation is also a monotonically non-increasing function of scale. Furthermore, we show that the new formulation defines a class of related complexity profile functions for a given system, demonstrating the generality of the formalism.},

Within the context of this model, we show that gang clustering and territory formation may arise under specific parameter choices and that a phase transition may occur between well\textendash mixed, possibly dilute configurations and well separated, clustered ones. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we study the phase transition between these two qualitatively different scenarios. In the mean\textendash fields rendition of this model, we identify parameter regimes where the transition is first or second order. In all cases, we have found that the transitions are a consequence solely of the gang to graffiti couplings, implying that direct gang to gang interactions are not strictly necessary for gang territory formation; in particular, graffiti may be the sole driving force behind gang clustering.

However, our empirical knowledge of these networks is typically incomplete and the space of simulation models and parameters is vast, leaving room for uncertainty in theoretical predictions. Here we show that a large fraction of this space of possibilities exhibits generic behaviors that are robust to modeling choices. We consider a wide array of model features, including interaction types and community structures, known to generate different dynamics for a few species. We combine these features in large simulated communities, and show that equilibrium diversity, functioning, and stability can be predicted analytically using a random model parameterized by a few statistical properties of the community. We give an ecological interpretation of this ``disordered'' limit where structure fails to emerge from complexity. We also demonstrate that some well-studied interaction patterns remain relevant in large ecosystems, but their impact can be encapsulated in a minimal number of additional parameters. Our approach provides a powerful framework for predicting the outcomes of ecosystem assembly and quantifying the added value of more detailed models and measurements.},

In this Review, we introduce network representations originating from different financial relation\-ships, including direct interactions such as loans, similarities such as co-ownership and higher-order relations such as contracts involving several parties (for example, credit default swaps) or multi\- layer connections (possibly extending to the real economy). We then review models of financial contagion capturing the diffusion and impact of shocks across each of these systems. We also discuss different notions of `equilibrium' in economics and statistical physics, and how they lead to maximum entropy ensembles of graphs, providing tools for financial network inference and the identification of early-warning signals of system-wide instabilities.},

Previous studies have demonstrated that undetectably weak somatosensory stimuli cause a functional deactivation or inhibition in somatosensory cortex. In the present study, we tested whether invisible visual stimuli lead to similar responses, indicated by an increase in EEG alpha-band power - an index of cortical excitability. We presented subliminal and supraliminal visual stimuli after estimating each participant's detection threshold. Stimuli consisted of peripherally presented small circular patches that differed in their contrast to a background consisting of a random white noise pattern. We demonstrate that subliminal and supraliminal stimuli each elicit specific neuronal response patterns. Supraliminal stimuli evoked an early, strongly phase-locked lower-frequency response representing the evoked potential and induced a decrease in alpha-band power from 400 ms on. By contrast, subliminal visual stimuli induced an increase of non-phase-locked power around 300 ms that was maximal within the alpha-band. This response might be due to an inhibitory mechanism, which reduces spurious visual activation that is unlikely to result from external stimuli.},

In noninvertible systems, or in systems without inherent symmetries, the synchronization set--by which we mean graph(phi)--can be extremely complicated. We identify, describe, and give examples of several different complications that can arise, and we link each to inherent properties of the underlying dynamics. In brief, synchronization sets can in general become nondifferentiable, and in the more severe case of noninvertible dynamics, they might even be multivalued. We suggest two different ways to quantify these features, and we discuss possible failures in detecting chaos synchrony using standard continuity-based methods when these features are present.}

The formalism covers a broad range of steady-state dynamical processes and offers testable predictions regarding the system's response to perturbations and the development of correlations. It predicts several distinct universality classes whose characteristics can be derived directly from the continuum equation governing the system's dynamics and which are validated on several canonical network-based dynamical systems, from biochemical dynamics to epidemic spreading. Finally, we collect experimental data pertaining to social and biological systems, demonstrating that we can accurately uncover their universality class even in the absence of an appropriate continuum theory that governs the system's dynamics.},

Here, we review briefly the foundational concepts of graph theoretical estimation and generation of small-world networks. We take stock of some of the key developments in the field in the past decade and we consider in some detail the implications of recent studies using high-resolution tract-tracing methods to map the anatomical networks of the macaque and the mouse. In doing so, we draw attention to the important methodological distinction between topological analysis of binary or unweighted graphs, which have provided a popular but simple approach to brain network analysis in the past, and the topology of weighted graphs, which retain more biologically relevant information and are more appropriate to the increasingly sophisticated data on brain connectivity emerging from contemporary tract-tracing and other imaging studies. We conclude by highlighting some possible future trends in the further development of weighted small-worldness as part of a deeper and broader understanding of the topology and the functional value of the strong and weak links between areas of mammalian cortex.},

Understanding the effects of ligands on these signaling pathways could provide insights into disease pathophysiologies and treatment. The dopamine D2 receptor is a GPCR strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia. Previous studies from our lab have shown the preclinical efficacy of a novel allosteric drug, 3(R)- [(2(S)-pyrrolidinylcarbonyl)amino]-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidineacetamide (PAOPA), in attenuating schizophrenia-like behavioural abnormalities in rodent models of the disease. As an allosteric modulator, PAOPA binds to a site on the D2 receptor, which is distinct from the endogenous ligand-binding site, in order to modulate the binding of the D2 receptor ligand, dopamine. The exact signaling pathways affected by this allosteric modulator are currently unknown. The objectives of this study were to decipher the in vivo effects, in rats, of chronic PAOPA administration on D2 receptor regulatory and downstream molecules, including GRK2, arrestin-3 and extracellular receptor kinase (ERK) 1/2. Additionally, an in vitro cellular model was also used to study PAOPA's effects on D2 receptor internalization. Results from western immunoblots showed that chronic PAOPA treatment increased the striatal expression of GRK2 by 41\%, arrestin-3 by 34\%, phospho-ERK1 by 51\% and phospho-ERK2 by 36\%. Results also showed that the addition of PAOPA to agonist treatment in cells increased D2 receptor internalization by 33\%. This study provides the foundational evidence of putative signaling pathways, and changes in receptor localization, affected by treatment with PAOPA. It improves our understanding on the diverse mechanisms of action of allosteric modulators, while advancing PAOPA's development into a novel drug for the improved treatment of schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {The past couple of decades has witnessed an unprecedented rise in organized crime. This rise, coupled with increasing intricacies of organized crime, poses significant and evolving challenges for international law enforcement authorities. With the passage of time, authorities such as Interpol, have discovered that modern criminal organizations have adopted a networked structure, a shift away from the traditional hierarchical structure. Fluid networked structures make it difficult for the authorities to apprehend individuals associated with each network, and consequently, to disrupt the operations of the network. Various research groups have analyzed prison/courtroom transcripts, to create an organizational structure of known individuals, or a social network of individuals, suspected to be a part of a major drug/terrorist organization. These social networks have been studied fairly extensively from network centrality perspectives, to understand the role of suspect individuals in the network. Additionally, with drug and terror offenses increasing globally, the list of suspect individuals has also been growing over the past decade. As it takes significant amount of technical and human resources to monitor a suspect, an increasing list entails higher resource requirements on the part of the authorities, and monitoring all the suspects soon becomes an impossible task. In this paper, we primarily focus on two types of networks \textendash{} (i) Drug Trafficking Organizations, and (ii) Terrorist Organizations, and present a methodology for the surveillance of individuals associated with these networks. Our methodology is based on the mathematical notion of Identifying Codes, which ensures reduction in resources on the part of law enforcement authorities, without compromising the ability to uniquely identify a suspect, when they become ``active'' in drug/terror related activities. Furthermore, we show that our approach requires far lesser resources when compared to strategies adopting standard network centrality measures for the unique identification of individuals. In other words, we show that the strategy of monitoring individuals in such networks, by utilizing centrality measures is wasteful, on the part of the authorities. Finally, we evaluate the efficacy of our approach on real world datasets.},

That is, I will argue that intuition underdetermines theory choice in epistemology, in much the way that observation underdetermines theory choices in empirical sciences. If reflective equilibrium leads to the underdetermination problem I say it leads to, then it cannot satisfy the aims of contemporary epistemology, and so cannot serve as its standard methodology.},

In order to verify computationally the relationships between stimulus and response for spiking neurons, we investigate small-world networks of neurons described by the Hodgkin-Huxley equations connected by chemical synapses.

  abstract = {Synergies between evolutionary game theory and statistical physics have significantly improved our understanding of public cooperation in structured populations. Multiplex networks, in particular, provide the theoretical framework within network science that allows us to mathematically describe the rich structure of interactions characterizing human societies. While research has shown that multiplex networks may enhance the resilience of cooperation, the interplay between the overlap in the structure of the layers and the control parameters of the corresponding games has not yet been investigated. With this aim, we consider here the public goods game on a multiplex network, and we unveil the role of the number of layers and the overlap of links, as well as the impact of different synergy factors in different layers, on the onset of cooperation. We show that enhanced public cooperation emerges only when a significant edge overlap is combined with at least one layer being able to sustain some cooperation by means of a sufficiently high synergy factor. In the absence of either of these conditions, the evolution of cooperation in multiplex networks is determined by the bounds of traditional network reciprocity with no enhanced resilience. These results caution against overly optimistic predictions that the presence of multiple social domains may in itself promote cooperation, and they help us better understand the complexity behind prosocial behavior in layered social systems.},

  abstract = {The complexity of many biological, social and technological systems stems from the richness of the interactions among their units. Over the past decades, a variety of complex systems has been successfully described as networks whose interacting pairs of nodes are connected by links. Yet, from human communications to chemical reactions and ecological systems, interactions can often occur in groups of three or more nodes and cannot be described simply in terms of dyads. Until recently little attention has been devoted to the higher-order architecture of real complex systems. However, a mounting body of evidence is showing that taking the higher-order structure of these systems into account can enhance our modeling capacities and help us understand and predict their dynamical behavior. Here we present a complete overview of the emerging field of networks beyond pairwise interactions. We discuss how to represent higher-order interactions and introduce the different frameworks used to describe higher-order systems, highlighting the links between the existing concepts and representations. We review the measures designed to characterize the structure of these systems and the models proposed to generate synthetic structures, such as random and growing bipartite graphs, hypergraphs and simplicial complexes. We introduce the rapidly growing research on higher-order dynamical systems and dynamical topology, discussing the relations between higher-order interactions and collective behavior. We focus in particular on new emergent phenomena characterizing dynamical processes, such as diffusion, synchronization, spreading, social dynamics and games, when extended beyond pairwise interactions. We conclude with a summary of empirical applications, and an outlook on current modeling and conceptual frontiers.},

Despite increasing efforts, the dynamics leading to the emergence of these phenomena remain unclear. We propose a model that introduces the dynamics of radicalization as a reinforcing mechanism driving the evolution to extreme opinions from moderate initial conditions. Inspired by empirical findings on social interaction dynamics, we consider agents characterized by heterogeneous activities and homophily. We show that the transition between a global consensus and emerging radicalized states is mostly governed by social influence and by the controversialness of the topic discussed. Compared with empirical data of polarized debates on Twitter, the model qualitatively reproduces the observed relation between users' engagement and opinions, as well as opinion segregation in the interaction network. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms that may lie at the core of the emergence of echo chambers and polarization in social media.},

We prove that when only one action can be implemented, law enforcement will take action (either target or arrest) on the highest known criminal type to them. Our results demonstrate that: (i) it may be valuable to diversify the action taken on the same criminal type when more than one action can be implemented; (ii) the marginal improvement in terms of the value of the criminals interdicted per unit time by increasing available resources decreases as resource level increases; and (iii) there are losses that arise from not holistically planning the actions of all available resources across distinct operations against drug trafficking networks.},

In recent decades these disciplines integrated, and with the advent of techniques for imaging activity in human brains, the term cognitive neuroscience has been applied to the integrated investigations of mind and brain.

In order to avoid overfitting, we employ objective estimation of the amount of Gaussian noise through Bayesian analysis of the true dimensionality of the data, i.e., the number of activation and non-Gaussian noise sources. This enables us to carry out probabilistic modeling and achieves an asymptotically unique decomposition of the data. It reduces problems of interpretation, as each final independent component is now much more likely to be due to only one physical or physiological process. We also describe other improvements to standard ICA, such as temporal prewhitening and variance normalization of timeseries, the latter being particularly useful in the context of dimensionality reduction when weak activation is present. We discuss the use of prior information about the spatiotemporal nature of the source processes, and an alternative-hypothesis testing approach for inference, using Gaussian mixture models. The performance of our approach is illustrated and evaluated on real and artificial FMRI data, and compared to the spatio-temporal accuracy of results obtained from classical ICA and GLM analyses.},

Excitatory autaptic currents reversed near the potential expected for monovalent cations were blocked by the glutamatergic antagonist kynurenic acid, and possessed a slow component with the pharmacological profile of N-methyl-D-aspartate-type channels. These currents also exhibited trial-to-trial statistical fluctuations in their amplitudes, this being well-described by quantal analysis. Inhibitory autaptic currents reversed at hyperpolarized potentials, as expected for chloride-permeable pores and were blocked by picrotoxin, a type A gamma-aminobutyric receptor antagonist.

  abstract = {In recent years, the development and extensive use of optogenetics resulted in impressive findings on the neurobiology of anxiety and depression in animals. Indeed, it permitted to depict precisely the role of specific cell populations in various brain areas, including the amygdala nuclei, the auditory cortex, the anterior cingulate, the hypothalamus, the hippocampus and the bed nucleus of stria terminalis in specific aspects of fear and anxiety behaviors. Moreover, these findings emphasized the involvement of projections from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens and the medial prefrontal cortex in eliciting depressive-like behaviors in stress-resilient mice or in inhibiting the expression of such behaviors in stress-vulnerable mice. Here we describe the optogenetic toolbox, including recent developments, and then review how the use of this technique contributed to dissect further the circuit underlying anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. We then point to some drawbacks of the current studies, particularly a) the sharp contrast between the sophistication of the optogenetic tools and the rudimentary aspect of the behavioral assays used, b) the fact that the studies were generally undertaken using normal rodents, that is animals that have not been subjected to experimental manipulations shifting them to a state relevant for pathologies and c) that the opportunity to explore the potential of these techniques to develop innovative therapeutics has been fully ignored yet. Finally, we discuss the point that these findings frequently ignore the complexity of the circuitry, as they focus only on a particular subpart of it. We conclude that users of this cutting edge technology could benefit from dialog between behavioral neuroscientists, psychiatrists and pharmacologists to further improve the impact of the findings. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {When applied economists want to focus attention on a single commodity or on one commodity group, they often find it convenient to work with a two-commodity model, where the two commodities are the one that they plan to study and a composite commodity called " other goods " . For example, someone interested in the economics of nutrition may wish to work with a model where one commodity is an aggregate commodity " food " and the other is " money left over for other goods. " To do so, they need to determine which goods are foods and which are not and then define the quantity of the aggregate commodity, food, as some function of the quantities of each of the food goods. In the standard economic model of intertemporal choice model of in-tertemporal choice, commodities are distinguished not only by their physical attributes, but also by the date at which they are consumed. In this model, if there are T time periods, and n undated commodities, then the total number of dated commodities is nT . Macroeconomic studies that focus on savings and investment decisions often assume that there is just one " ag-gregate good " consumed in each time period and that the only non-trivial consumer decisions concern the time path of consumption of this single good. In these examples, and in many other applications of economics, the tactic of reducing the number of commodities by aggregation can make difficult problems much more manageable. In general, such simplifications can only be purchased at the cost of realism. Here we examine the " separability conditions " that must hold if this aggregation is legitimate. To pursue the food example, suppose that the set of n commodities can be partitioned into two groups, foods and non-foods. Let there be m food commodities. We will write commodity vectors in the form x = (x F , x {$\sim$}F) where x F is a vector listing quantities of each of the food goods and x {$\sim$}F is a vector quantities of each of the non-food goods. If we are going to be able to aggregate, it must be that consumers have preferences representable by utility functions u of the form u (x F , x {$\sim$}F) = U * (f (x F), x {$\sim$}F) f is a real-valued function of m variables and where U * is a strictly increasing function of its first argument. The function f is then a measure of the amount 1 of the aggregate commodity food. Notice that the function u is a function of n variables, while U * is an function of only n - m + 1 variables, which denote quantities of each of the non-food variables and a quantity of the food aggregate f . Economists' standard general model of intertemporal choice, is based on the use of dated commodities. Thus if there are n " undated commodities, " and T time periods, we define x it to be the quantity of commodity i con-sumed in period t. We define x t to be the n-vector of commodities consumed in period t and we define x = (x 1 , . . . , x T) to be the nT -vector listing con-sumption of each good in each period. This is sometimes called a time profile of consumption. We assume that individuals have preferences over time pro-files of consumption that are representable by a utility function u(x 1 , . . . , x T) where each x i is an n-vector. Suppose that u takes the special form u(x 1 , . . . , x T) = U * (f 1 (x 1), . . . , f T (x T))}

  abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of the targeting of key players by law enforcement on the structure, communication strategies, and activities of a drug trafficking network. Data are extracted from judicial court documents. The unique nature of the investigation \textendash which saw a key player being arrested mid-investigation but police monitoring continuing for another year \textendash{} allows to compare the network before and after targeting. This paper combines a quantitative element where network statistics and exponential random graph models are used to describe and explain structural changes over time, and a qualitative element where the content of wiretapped conversations is analysed. After law enforcement tar\- geting, network members favoured security over efficiency, although criminal collaboration continued after the arrest of the key player. This paper contributes to the growing literature on the efficiency-security trade-off in criminal networks, and discusses policy implications for repressive policies in illegal drug markets.},

The country has boasted a rare combination of high overall level, as well as uniquely good outcomes of the bottom performers. However, the latest PISA results and the recent socio-spatial developments within the Finnish cities challenge this nationally celebrated balance in schools and urban social structure. Until now, research evidence has demonstrated that in the Finnish context with a powerful, universalist welfare state and a highly educated, homogenous population, differentiation increases mainly by the growth of an elite. Our analysis of large datasets from schools and neighbourhoods in Helsinki suggests that this development has been overturned in the local level: segregation has begun to increase and appears to operate through the trends of middle-class avoidance and the decline of the underprivileged groups in urban schools and neighbourhoods. \{\textcopyright\} 2016, \{\textcopyright\} Urban Studies Journal Limited 2016.},

This field emerged around a list of research questions that were not answered within the classical framework of learning theory. These questions concern: the outstanding generalization power of overparametrized neural networks, the role of depth in deep architectures, the apparent absence of the curse of dimensionality, the surprisingly successful optimization performance despite the non-convexity of the problem, understanding what features are learned, why deep architectures perform exceptionally well in physical problems, and which fine aspects of an architecture affect the behavior of a learning task in which way. We present an overview of modern approaches that yield partial answers to these questions. For selected approaches, we describe the main ideas in more detail.},

To what extent do different subgroups provide the same, i.e. shared or redundant, information, carry unique information or interact for the emergence of synergistic information? Recently Williams and Beer proposed such a decomposition based on natural properties for shared information. While these properties fix the structure of the decomposition, they do not uniquely specify the values of the different terms. Therefore, we investigate additional properties such as strong symmetry and left monotonicity. We find that strong symmetry is incompatible with the properties proposed by Williams and Beer. Although left monotonicity is a very natural property for an information measure it is not fulfilled by any of the proposed measures.},

Three qualitatively different behaviors are found in the limit of large observation times \$T\$: \$I\_\{\textbackslash rm pred\} (T)\$ can remain finite, grow logarithmically, or grow as a fractional power law. If the time series allows us to learn a model with a finite number of parameters, then \$I\_\{\textbackslash rm pred\} (T)\$ grows logarithmically with a coefficient that counts the dimensionality of the model space. In contrast, power--law growth is associated, for example, with the learning of infinite parameter (or nonparametric) models such as continuous functions with smoothness constraints. There are connections between the predictive information and measures of complexity that have been defined both in learning theory and in the analysis of physical systems through statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory. Further, in the same way that entropy provides the unique measure of available information consistent with some simple and plausible conditions, we argue that the divergent part of \$I\_\{\textbackslash rm pred\} (T)\$ provides the unique measure for the complexity of dynamics underlying a time series. Finally, we discuss how these ideas may be useful in different problems in physics, statistics, and biology.},

We also discuss how these errors affect the very similar Friston (2014, https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2014.2306251) and, where appropriate, mention consequences for the newer proposals in Friston (2019, arXiv:1906.10184v1 ) and Parr et al. (2019, https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2019.0159). The errors call into question the purported interpretation that the internal coordinates of every system with a Markov blanket will appear to engage in Bayesian inference. In particular, in addition to highlighting the implicit restriction to linear models, we identify three formal errors in the main argument of Friston (2013): The first concerns the rewriting of the equations of motion of systems with Markov blankets which turns out not to be generally correct. We prove the non-equivalence with a counterexample that exhibits a Markov blanket but does not satisfy the rewritten equations. Our counterexample also invalidates the corresponding (but more general) rewritten equations in the more recent Friston (2019). The second error concerns the Free Energy Lemma itself, which we prove, by counterexample, to be wrong in general. The third is the claim that the Free Energy Lemma, when it does hold, implies equality of variational density and ergodic conditional density. The interpretation in terms of Bayesian inference hinges on this point, and we hence conclude that it is unjustified. Additionally, we highlight that the definitions of the Markov blanket in Friston (2013) and Parr et al. (2019) are not equivalent and that the assumptions in Parr et al. (2019) may be too strong to allow for meaningful interpretation.},

The first approach to capture the global properties of such systems is to model them as graphs whose nodes represent the dynamical units, and whose links stand for the interactions between them. On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks' dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Networks are finite metric spaces, with distances defined by the shortest paths between nodes. However, this is not the only form of network geometry: two others are the geometry of latent spaces underlying many networks and the effective geometry induced by dynamical processes in networks. These three approaches to network geometry are intimately related, and all three of them have been found to be exceptionally efficient in discovering fractality, scale invariance, self-s imilarity and other forms of fundamental symmetries in networks. Network geometry is also of great use in a variety of practical applications, from understanding how the brain works to routing in the Internet. We review the most important theoretical and practical developments dealing with these approaches to network geometry and offer perspectives on future research directions and challenges in this frontier in the study of complexity.},

By performing Monte-Carlo simulations, we confirm the exactness of our main theoretical results and show that the typical time the system needs to escape from a metastable state grows exponentially fast as a function of the temperature, characterizing ergodicity breaking in the thermodynamic limit.},

The presented text contains description of two different ways how the mathematical description of kinematics and dynamics of classical systems emerges from the mathematical formalism of QM. The first of these ways is to obtain an equivalent description of QM (with finite number of degrees of freedom) as a classical Hamiltonian field theory and afterwards restrict it in dependence of specific classical system to obtain the classical Hamiltonian mechanics of that system. The second way is transition to QM of systems with infinite number of degrees of freedom - i.e. of macroscopic systems - and extract from it classical mechanics (with finite number of degrees of freedom) of macroscopic variables of this quantum system. The last 7th chapter of the text contains some considerations concerning the "measurement problem in QM", in which a measured quantum "microsystem" has to be dynamically connected with changes of classical states of a macroscopic quantum (sub-)system - the measuring device. Several models of this process are presented.},

In particular, acyclic SCMs, also known as recursive SEMs, form a well-studied subclass of SCMs that generalize causal Bayesian networks to allow for latent confounders. In this paper, we investigate SCMs in a more general setting, allowing for the presence of both latent confounders and cycles. We show that in the presence of cycles, many of the convenient properties of acyclic SCMs do not hold in general: they do not always have a solution; they do not always induce unique observational, interventional and counterfactual distributions; a marginalization does not always exist, and if it exists the marginal model does not always respect the latent projection; they do not always satisfy a Markov property; and their graphs are not always consistent with their causal semantics. We prove that for SCMs in general each of these properties does hold under certain solvability conditions. Our work generalizes results for SCMs with cycles that were only known for certain special cases so far. We introduce the class of simple SCMs that extends the class of acyclic SCMs to the cyclic setting, while preserving many of the convenient properties of acyclic SCMs. With this paper we aim to provide the foundations for a general theory of statistical causal modeling with SCMs.},

  abstract = {Centrality measures, or at least popular interpretations of these measures, make implicit assumptions about the manner in which traffic flows through a network. For example, some measures count only geodesic paths, apparently assuming that whatever flows through the network only moves along the shortest possible paths. This paper lays out a typology of network flows based on two dimensions of variation, namely the kinds of trajectories that traffic may follow (geodesics, paths, trails, or walks) and the method of spread (broadcast, serial replication, or transfer). Measures of centrality are then matched to the kinds of flows that they are appropriate for. Simulations are used to examine the relationship between type of flow and the differential importance of nodes with respect to key measurements such as speed of reception of traffic and frequency of receiving traffic. It is shown that the off-the-shelf formulas for centrality measures are fully applicable only for the specific flow processes they are designed for, and that when they are applied to other flow processes they get the "wrong" answer. It is noted that the most commonly used centrality measures are not appropriate for most of the flows we are routinely interested in. A key claim made in this paper is that centrality measures can be regarded as generating expected values for certain kinds of node outcomes (such as speed and frequency of reception) given implicit models of how traffic flows, and that this provides a new and useful way of thinking about centrality. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The concept of centrality is often invoked in social network analysis, and diverse indices have been proposed to measure it. This paper develops a unified framework for the measurement of centrality. All measures of centrality assess a node's involvement in the walk structure of a network. Measures vary along four key dimensions: type of nodal involvement assessed, type of walk considered, property of walk assessed, and choice of summary measure. If we cross-classify measures by type of nodal involvement (radial versus medial) and property of walk assessed (volume versus length), we obtain a four-fold polychotomization with one cell empty which mirrors Freeman's 1979 categorization. At a more substantive level, measures of centrality summarize a node's involvement in or contribution to the cohesiveness of the network. Radial measures in particular are reductions of pair-wise proximities/cohesion to attributes of nodes or actors. The usefulness and interpretability of radial measures depend on the fit of the cohesion matrix to the one-dimensional model. In network terms, a network that is fit by a one-dimensional model has a core-periphery structure in which all nodes revolve more or less closely around a single core. This in turn implies that the network does not contain distinct cohesive subgroups. Thus, centrality is shown to be intimately connected with the cohesive subgroup structure of a network. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We explain empirical comorbidity patterns based on a network model of psychiatric symptoms, derived from an analysis of symptom overlap in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that a) half of the symptoms in the DSM-IV network are connected, b) the architecture of these connections conforms to a small world structure, featuring a high degree of clustering but a short average path length, and c) distances between disorders in this structure predict empirical comorbidity rates. Network simulations of Major Depressive Episode and Generalized Anxiety Disorder show that the model faithfully reproduces empirical population statistics for these disorders. CONCLUSIONS: In the network model, mental disorders are inherently complex. This explains the limited successes of genetic, neuroscientific, and etiological approaches to unravel their causes. We outline a psychosystems approach to investigate the structure and dynamics of mental disorders.},

We show how to use information theory to validate simple stimulus-response models of neural coding of dynamic stimuli. Because these models require specification of spike timing precision, they can reveal which time scales contain information in neural coding. This approach shows that dynamic stimuli can be encoded efficiently by single neurons and that each spike contributes to information transmission.

However, it is still unknown whether gamma-band synchronization subserves a single universal function or a diversity of functions across the full spectrum of cognitive processes. Here, we address this question reviewing the mechanisms of gamma-band oscillation generation and the functions associated with gamma-band activity across several cortical and subcortical structures. Additionally, we raise a plausible explanation of why gamma rhythms are found so ubiquitously across brain structures. Gamma band activity originates from the interplay between inhibition and excitation. We stress that gamma oscillations, associated with this interplay, originate from basic functional motifs that conferred advantages for low-level system processing and multiple cognitive functions throughout evolution. We illustrate the multifunctionality of gamma-band activity by considering its role in neural systems for perception, selective attention, memory, motivation and behavioral control. We conclude that gamma-band oscillations support multiple cognitive processes, rather than a single one, which, however, can be traced back to a limited set of circuit motifs which are found universally across species and brain structures.},

By hypothetically allocating children to the nearest schools, this article demonstrates that even in a highly choice-based school context school segregation is to a large extent the effect of residential patterns. The role of residential trends, notably gentrification, is therefore crucial for understanding the differences in current trends of school segregation across Duthc urban contexts.},

The focus on collaboration raises the boundary specification problem: Where do criminal organizations start, where do they end, and who is involved? Traditional approaches sometimes assume the existence of simple, rigid structures when complexity and fluidity are the norms. A network approach embraces this complexity conceptually and provides methodological guidelines for clarifying boundaries. Boundary specification in organized crime helps solve four puzzles. First, social boundaries: a network approach reduces confusion about social boundaries as criminal entrepreneurs interact with criminals and noncriminals in diverse contexts, only some of them illicit. Second, boundaries of group membership: network data and methods obviate the need for formal membership attributions. Third, ethnic boundaries network analyses reveal that the effective boundaries of criminal organizations are based on social relations, not attributes such as ethnicity. Fourth, recruitment: attending to the larger social environments in which organizations are embedded provides a clearer view of how mechanisms of recruitment cross seemingly rigid boundaries between members and prospective members.},

We challenge this view and argue that more traditional, non-Bayesian approaches are more promising.  We make three main arguments.  First, we show that the empirical evidence for Bayesian theories in psychology is weak at best.  This weakness relates to the many arbitrary ways that priors, likelihoods, and utility functions can be altered in order to account for the data that are obtained, making the models unfalsifiable.  It further relates to the fact that Bayesian theories are rarely better at predicting data compared to alternative (and simpler) non-Bayesian theories.  Second, we show that the empirical evidence for Bayesian theories in neuroscience is weaker still.  There are impressive mathematical analyses showing how populations of neurons could compute in a Bayesian manner but little or no evidence that they do.  Third, we challenge the general scientific approach that characterizes Bayesian theorizing in cognitive science.  A common premise is that theories in psychology should largely be constrained by a rational analysis of what the mind ought to do in order to perform optimally. We question this claim and argue that many of the important constraints come from biological, evolutionary, and processing (algorithmic) considerations that have no adaptive relevance to the problem per se.  In our view, these factors have contributed to the development of many Bayesian ``just-so'' stories in psychology and neuroscience; that is, mathematical analyses of cognition that can be used to explain almost any behavior as optimal.},

In this way, dynamical instability in the control protocol plays an essential and constructive role in intelligent thermodynamic systems.},

We adapted for this purpose the naturally occurring algal protein Channelrhodopsin-2, a rapidly gated light-sensitive cation channel, by using lentiviral gene delivery in combination with high-speed optical switching to photostimulate mammalian neurons. We demonstrate reliable, millisecond-timescale control of neuronal spiking, as well as control of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. This technology allows the use of light to alter neural processing at the level of single spikes and synaptic events, yielding a widely applicable tool for neuroscientists and biomedical engineers.},

  abstract = {Differential Evolution (DE) is a simple genetic algorithm for numerical optimization in real parameter spaces. In a statistical context one would not just want the optimum but also its uncertainty. The uncertainty distribution can be obtained by a Bayesian analysis (after specifying prior and likelihood) using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. In this paper the essential ideas of DE and MCMC are integrated into Differential Evolution Markov Chain (DE-MC). DE-MC is a population MCMC algorithm, in which multiple chains are run in parallel. DE-MC solves an important problem in MCMC, namely that of choosing an appropriate scale and orientation for the jumping distribution. In DE-MC the jumps are simply a multiple of the differences of two random parameter vectors that are currently in the population. Simulations and examples illustrate the potential of DE-MC. The advantage of DE-MC over conventional MCMC are simplicity, speed of calculation and convergence, even for nearly collinear parameters and multimodal densities. :}

The neurologic manifestations of these conditions include parenchymal brain and brainstem disease, myelopathy, radiculopathy, myopathy, and all forms of peripheral neuropathy. Recognizing when a neurologic concern is related to immune-mediated or alternative mechanisms is a critical role for the neurologist as treatment decisions may be based on this assessment. Familiarity with the neurologic manifestations of systemic rheumatologic disease is therefore critical. The approach to treatment depends on the underlying mechanisms of disease and decisions should be made in consultation with other experts assisting in the clinical care of an individual patient.},

Strong multisensory processes are present in the general population, but the relationship between these 'normal' sensory interactions and synesthesia is currently unknown. Neuroimaging research suggests that some forms of synesthesia are caused by enhanced cross-activation between brain areas specialized for the processing of different sensory attributes, and finds evidence of increased white matter connections among regions known to be involved in typical crossmodal processes. Using two classic crossmodal integration tasks we show that grapheme-color synesthetes exhibit enhanced crossmodal interactions between auditory and visual modalities, suggesting that the experience of synesthesia in one modality generalizes to enhanced crossmodal processes with other modalities. This finding supports our conjecture that the atypical sensory experiences of synesthetes represent a selective expression of a more diffuse propensity toward 'typical' crossmodality interactions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Srl.},

This paper introduces a series of IBM-applications in the ecosystem research project 'Bornh\"oved Lakes District'. Here we outline the general theoretical implications of individual-based modelling related to self-organisation processes and emergent properties in different fields of ecological research and characterise the conceptual basis common to these applications. The case studies introduced are: spatial dispersal and colonisation processes of terrestrial arthropodscommunity dynamics and trophic interaction in small mammalslimnological application - spatially explicit fish energetic population modelplant root system development and nutrient acquisition dynamicsplant architecture and assimilation physiology We used the IBM-approach to analyse fundamental biocenotical interactions and investigate, how dispersal processes, behavioural characteristics and energetics at the level of individual organisms are linked with the population level and community processes as well as with ecosystem and landscape structures. The ecosystem based investigations are presented together with an overview of the employed modelling methodology. In addition, it is explained, how the conceptual background of emergent properties is involved in this approach. The individual-based modelling approach allows realistic descriptions and is highly adaptive to particular contexts and questions under investigation. Its main feature is that the characteristics of higher level ecological units like populations or communities can be determined as emergent properties from the lower ones. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Lentiviral vectors have emerged as promising tools for both gene therapy and immunotherapy purposes. They exhibit several advantages over other viral systems in that they are less immunogenic and are capable of transducing a wide range of different cell types, including dendritic cells (DC). DC transduced ex vivo with a whole range of different (tumor) antigens were capable of inducing strong antigen-specific T-cell responses, both in vitro and in vivo. Recently, the administration of lentiviral vectors in vivo has gained substantial interest as an alternative method for antigen-specific immunization. This method offers a number of advantages over DC vaccines as the same lentivirus can in principle be used for all patients resulting in a significantly reduced cost and requirement for considerably less expertise for the generation and administration of lentiviral vaccines. By selectively targeting lentiviral vectors to, or restricting transgene expression in certain cell types, selectivity, safety and efficacy can be further improved. This review will focus on the use of direct administration of lentiviral vectors encoding tumor-associated antigens (TAA) for the induction of tumor-specific immune responses in vivo, with a special focus on problems related to the generation of large amounts of highly purified virus and specific targeting of antigen-presenting cells (APC).},

Our simple model predicts correctly the timing of 96\% of the spikes (+/-2 ms) of the detailed model in response to injection of noisy synaptic conductances. The model is especially reliable in high-conductance states, typical of cortical activity in vivo, in which intrinsic conductances were found to have a reduced role in shaping spike trains. These results are promising because this simple model has enough expressive power to reproduce qualitatively several electrophysiological classes described in vitro.},

  abstract = {orks. Assumptions underlying centrality indices, such as presence of a flow and shortest paths, may not correspond with a general theory of how psychological variables relate to one another. Furthermore, the assumptions of node distinctiveness and node exchangeability may not hold in psychological networks. We conclude that, for psychological networks, especially betweenness and closeness centrality seem unsuitable as measures of node importance. We therefore suggest three ways forward: (1) using centrality measures that are tailored to the psychological network context, (2) reconsidering existing measures of importance used in statistical models underlying psychological networks, and (3) leaving the whole idea of node centrality behind. Foremost, we argue that one has to make explicit what is meant with being central and what assumptions the centrality measure of choice entails to make sure that there is a match between the process under study and the centrality measure that is used.}

We have measured the responses of neurons in area MT of the alert monkey while we varied the strength and direction of the motion signal in such displays. The strength of motion is controlled by the proportion of spatiotemporally correlated dots, which we term the correlation of the stimulus. For many MT cells, responses varied approximately linearly with stimulus correlation. When they occurred, nonlinearities were equally likely to be either positively or negatively accelerated. We also explored the relationship between response magnitude and response variance for these cells and found, in general agreement with other investigators, that this relationship conforms to a power law with an exponent slightly greater than 1. The variance of the cells' discharge is little influenced by the trial-to-trial fluctuations inherent in our stochastic display, and is therefore likely to be of neural origin. Linear responses to these stochastic motion stimuli are predicted by simple, low-level motion models incorporating sensors having relatively broad spatial and temporal frequency tuning.},

Here, we use examples to show that models can serve a wide variety of roles, including hypothesis testing, generating new insights, deepening understanding, suggesting and interpreting experiments, tracing chains of causation, doing sensitivity analyses, integrating knowledge, and inspiring new approaches. We show that models can bring together information of different kinds and do so across a range of length scales, as they do in multi-scale, multi-faceted embryogenesis models, some of which connect gene expression, the cytoskeleton, cell properties, tissue mechanics, morphogenetic movements and phenotypes. Models cannot replace experiments nor can they prove that particular mechanisms are at work in a given situation. But they can demonstrate whether or not a proposed mechanism is sufficient to produce an observed phenomenon. Although the examples in this article are taken primarily from the field of embryo mechanics, most of the arguments and discussion are applicable to any form of computational modelling.},

These are defined as the internal states of a system that lead to the same decision, based on a user-provided utility or pay-off function. The utility function encodes some a priori knowledge external to the system, it quantifies how bad it is to make mistakes. The intrinsic underlying structure of the system is modeled by an epsilon-machine and its causal states. The decisional states form a partition of the lower-level causal states that is defined according to the higher-level user's knowledge. In a complex systems perspective, the decisional states are thus the "emerging" patterns corresponding to the utility function. The transitions between these decisional states correspond to events that lead to a change of decision. The new REMAPF algorithm estimates both the epsilon-machine and the decisional states from data. Application examples are given for hidden model reconstruction, cellular automata filtering, and edge detection in images.},

The multifractal cumulants feature measures the signal regularity, while the predictive complexity measures the difficulty to predict the future of the signal based on its past, hence a degree of how complex it is. We have conducted an evaluation of the performance of these two novel features on EEG data corresponding to motor-imagery. We also compared them to the gold standard features used in the BCI field, namely the band-power features. We evaluated these three kinds of features and their combinations on EEG signals from 13 subjects. Results obtained show that our novel features can lead to BCI designs with improved classification performance, notably when using and combining the three kinds of feature (band-power, multifractal cumulants, predictive complexity) together. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

One approach involves focusing on problems such as the integration of information, the deliberate control of behavior, the ability to discriminate and categorize environmental stimuli, etc. These problems have been dubbed by philosophers as " easy " to suggest that the present limitations hindering progress could be overcome by more sophisticated methods in the near future (Chalmers, 1995, 1996). For example, explaining the integration of information requires describing the neurophysiological mechanisms responsible for information processing. Although these mechanisms are not currently well known, it is very likely that neuroscience will be able to explain them in the near future. It has been argued, however, that the problem of phenomenal consciousness cannot be explained by reference to such mechanisms because it involves a special kind of subjective qualities, i.e., phenomenal qualities that are present},

However, empirical evidence for this belief derives from a relatively small number of real-world networks. We test the universality of scale-free structure by applying state-of-the-art statistical tools to a large corpus of nearly 1000 network data sets drawn from social, biological, technological, and informational sources. We fit the power-law model to each degree distribution, test its statistical plausibility, and compare it via a likelihood ratio test to alternative, non-scale-free models, e.g., the log-normal. Across domains, we find that scale-free networks are rare, with only 4\% exhibiting the strongest-possible evidence of scale-free structure and 52\% exhibiting the weakest-possible evidence. Furthermore, evidence of scale-free structure is not uniformly distributed across sources: social networks are at best weakly scale free, while a handful of technological and biological networks can be called strongly scale free. These results undermine the universality of scale-free networks and reveal that real-world networks exhibit a rich structural diversity that will likely require new ideas and mechanisms to explain.}

  abstract = {In the present article the putative role of environmental factors in schizophrenia is reviewed and synthesized. Accumulating evidence from recent studies suggests that environmental exposures may play a more significant role in the etiopathogenesis of this disorder than previously thought. This expanding knowledge base is largely a consequence of refinements in the methodology of epidemiologic studies, including birth cohort investigations, and in preclinical research that has been inspired by the evolving literature on animal models of environmental exposures. This paper is divided into four sections. In the first, the descriptive epidemiology of schizophrenia is reviewed. This includes general studies on incidence, prevalence, and differences in these measures by urban-rural, neighborhood, migrant, and season of birth status, as well as time trends. In the second section, we discuss the contribution of environmental risk factors acting during fetal and perinatal life; these include infections [e.g. rubella, influenza, Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2)], nutritional deficiencies (e.g., famine, folic acid, iron, vitamin D), paternal age, fetal/neonatal hypoxic and other obstetric insults and complications, maternal stress and other exposures [e.g. lead, rhesus (Rh) incompatibility, maternal stress]. Other putative neurodevelopmental determinants, including cannabis, socioeconomic status, trauma, and infections during childhood and adolescence are also covered. In the third section, these findings are synthesized and their implications for prevention and uncovering biological mechanisms, including oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation, are discussed. Animal models, including maternal immune activation, have yielded evidence suggesting that these exposures cause brain and behavioral phenotypes that are analogous to findings observed in patients with schizophrenia. In the final section, future studies including new, larger, and more rigorous epidemiologic investigations, and research on translational and clinical neuroscience, gene-environment interactions, epigenetics, developmental trajectories and windows of vulnerability, are elaborated upon. These studies are aimed at confirming observed risk factors, identifying new environmental exposures, elucidating developmental mechanisms, and shedding further light on genes and exposures that may not be identified in the absence of these integrated approaches. The study of environmental factors in schizophrenia may have important implications for the identification of causes and prevention of this disorder, and offers the potential to complement, and refine, existing efforts on explanatory neurodevelopmental models.},

  abstract = {This review summarizes the brain mechanisms controlling sleep and wakefulness. Wakefulness promoting systems cause low-voltage, fast activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Multiple interacting neurotransmitter systems in the brain stem, hypothalamus, and basal forebrain converge onto common effector systems in the thalamus and cortex. Sleep results from the inhibition of wake-promoting systems by homeostatic sleep factors such as adenosine and nitric oxide and GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, resulting in large-amplitude, slow EEG oscillations. Local, activity-dependent factors modulate the amplitude and frequency of cortical slow oscillations. Non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep results in conservation of brain energy and facilitates memory consolidation through the modulation of synaptic weights. Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep results from the interaction of brain stem cholinergic, aminergic, and GABAergic neurons which control the activity of glutamatergic reticular formation neurons leading to REM sleep phenomena such as muscle atonia, REMs, dreaming, and cortical activation. Strong activation of limbic regions during REM sleep suggests a role in regulation of emotion. Genetic studies suggest that brain mechanisms controlling waking and NREM sleep are strongly conserved throughout evolution, underscoring their enormous importance for brain function. Sleep disruption interferes with the normal restorative functions of NREM and REM sleep, resulting in disruptions of breathing and cardiovascular function, changes in emotional reactivity, and cognitive impairments in attention, memory, and decision making.},

  abstract = {Tipping points abound in nature and society, and, from species extinction to stock market collapse, their prediction is of widespread importance. Global transfer entropy, a general measure of information flow, is an advance predictor for second order transitions, such as the Ising model ferromagnetic transition, where correlation lengths diverge at the transition giving long range order. Here we show that (a) global transfer entropy is also a predictor of finite first order transitions, such as ecology dynamics on coral reefs, which have latent heat and no correlation length divergence, and (b) analysis of information flow across state boundaries unifies both transition orders. Important real-world systems exhibit both orders, as does the canonical Potts spin model. Examples include: nematic crystals, fundamental to LED display and lighting technology; consciousness and anaesthesia. We obtain the first information-theoretic result for the high-order Potts model and the first demonstration of early warning of a first order transition. The unexpected earlier finding that global transfer entropy peaks on the disordered side of a transition is also found for finite first order systems, albeit not in the thermodynamic limit. By proposing that the interface length of clusters of each phase is the dominant region of information flow, we show that first and second order behaviour is consistent with flow magnitude.},

It is estimated that comorbid depression occurs in 50\% of patients, and perhaps (conservatively) 47\% of patients also have a lifetime diagnosis of comorbid substance abuse. This article chronicles these associations, examining whether these comorbidities are "more than chance" and might represent (distinct) phenotypes of schizophrenia.

We investigate how well the position of a node, characterized by standard network measures, can predict its epidemiological importance in any graph of a given number of nodes. This is in contrast to other studies that deal with the easier prediction problem of ranking nodes by their epidemic importance in given graphs. As a benchmark for epidemic importance, we calculate the exact expected outbreak size given a node as the source. We study exhaustively all graphs of a given size, so do not restrict ourselves to certain generative models for graphs, nor to graph data sets. Due to the large number of possible nonisomorphic graphs of a fixed size, we are limited to 10-node graphs. We find that combinations of two or more centralities are predictive (\$R\^2\$ scores of 0.91 or higher) even for the most difficult parameter values of the epidemic simulation. Typically, these successful combinations include one normalized spectral centralities (such as PageRank or Katz centrality) and one measure that is sensitive to the number of edges in the graph.},

It is argued that feedback connections are the best candidates for such rapid long-distance interconnections. In the integrated model, information arriving in the cortex from the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus is first sent and processed in the parietal cortex that is very rapidly activated by a visual stimulus. Results from this first-pass computation are then sent back by feedback connections to areas V1 and V2 that act as 'active black-boards' for the rest of the visual cortical areas: information retroinjected from the parietal cortex is used to guide further processing of parvocellular and koniocellular information in the inferotemporal cortex.},

  abstract = {The assembly of ecological communities from a pool of species is central to ecology, but the effect of this process on properties of community interaction networks is still largely unknown. Here, we use a systematic analytical framework to describe how assembly from a species pool gives rise to community network properties that differ from those of the pool: Compared to the pool, the community shows a bias towards higher carrying capacities, weaker competitive interactions and stronger beneficial interactions. Moreover, even if interactions between all pool species are completely random, community networks are more structured, with correlations between interspecies interactions, and between interactions and carrying capacities. Nonetheless, we show that these properties are not sufficient to explain the coexistence of all community species, and that it is a simple relation between interactions and species abundances that is responsible for the diversity within a community.},

  abstract = {The properties of hippocampal place cells are reviewed, with particular attention to the nature of the internal and external signals that support their firing. A neuronal simulation of the firing of place cells in open-field environments of varying shape is presented. This simulation is coupled with an existing model of how place-cell firing can be used to drive navigation, and is tested by implementation as a miniature mobile robot. The sensors on the robot provide visual, odometric and short-range proximity data, which are combined to estimate the distance of the walls of the enclosure from the robot and the robot's current heading direction. These inputs drive the hippocampal simulation, in which the robot's location is represented as the firing of place cells. If a goal location is encountered, learning occurs in connections from the concurrently active place cells to a set of 'goal cells', which guide subsequent navigation, allowing the robot to return to an unmarked location. The system shows good agreement with actual place-cell firing, and makes predictions regarding the firing of cells in the subiculum, the effect of blocking long-term synaptic changes, and the locus of search of rats after deformation of their environment.},

  abstract = {Although event-related potentials (ERPs) are widely used to study sensory, perceptual and cognitive processes, it remains unknown whether they are phase-locked signals superimposed upon the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) or result from phase-alignment of the EEG. Previous attempts to discriminate between these hypotheses have been unsuccessful but here a new test is presented based on the prediction that ERPs generated by phase-alignment will be associated with event-related changes in frequency whereas evoked-ERPs will not. Using empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which allows measurement of narrow-band changes in the EEG without predefining frequency bands, evidence was found for transient frequency slowing in recognition memory ERPs but not in simulated data derived from the evoked model. Furthermore, the timing of phase-alignment was frequency dependent with the earliest alignment occurring at high frequencies. Based on these findings, the Firefly model was developed, which proposes that both evoked and induced power changes derive from frequency-dependent phase-alignment of the ongoing EEG. Simulated data derived from the Firefly model provided a close match with empirical data and the model was able to account for i) the shape and timing of ERPs at different scalp sites, ii) the event-related desynchronization in alpha and synchronization in theta, and iii) changes in the power density spectrum from the pre-stimulus baseline to the post-stimulus period. The Firefly Model, therefore, provides not only a unifying account of event-related changes in the EEG but also a possible mechanism for cross-frequency information processing.},

These are major components of neural systems that are relevant to ADHD, including cognitive/attention networks, motor systems, and reward/feedback-based processing systems. Moreover, these areas interact with other brain circuits that have been implicated in ADHD, such as the "default mode" resting state network. The ADHD imaging data related to cingulo-frontal-parietal network dysfunction will be selectively highlighted here to help facilitate its integration with the other information presented in this special issue.

Social Networks and the Effect of Reputation on Cooperation. ISCORE Paper No. 42, Utrecht Universityx. We distinguish individual and group network measures. Applying a combination of approximation methods to the game-theoretic solution to the model, we derive hypotheses on the effects of density, outdegree centrality, and centralization on the level of trust a trustor can have in a trustee. We conclude that higher density and outdegree induce more trust. Centralization increases trust if it is `well organized,' i.e., actors who can place more trust are central in the network. Furthermore, we discuss theoretical evidence that the relative importance of density compared to outdegree increases if the trust problem at the dyadic level is large. Finally, we show that, in many situations, a few simple network measures explain most of the effects of the network structure as a whole. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Time-dependent intrinsic and extrinsic growth rates are considered in these models. Through the model per capita growth rate we obtain a heuristic general procedure to generate scaling functions to collapse data into a simple linear behavior even if an extrinsic growth rate is included. With this data collapse, all the models studied become independent from the parameters and initial condition. Analytical solutions are found when time-dependent coefficients are considered. These solutions allow us to perceive nontrivial transitions between species extinction and survival and to calculate the transition's critical exponents. Considering an extrinsic growth rate as a cancer treatment, we show that the relevant quantity depends not only on the intensity of the treatment, but also on when the cancerous cell growth is maximum.}

  abstract = {The concept of resonance in nonlinear systems is crucial and traditionally refers to a specific realization of maximum response provoked by a particular external perturbation. Depending on the system and the nature of perturbation, many different resonance types have been identified in various fields of science. A prominent example is in neuroscience where it has been widely accepted that a neural system may exhibit resonances at microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic scales and benefit from such resonances in various tasks. In this context, the two well-known forms are stochastic and vibrational resonance phenomena which manifest that detection and propagation of a feeble information signal in neural structures can be enhanced by additional perturbations via these two resonance mechanisms. Given the importance of network architecture in proper functioning of the nervous system, we here present a review of recent studies on stochastic and vibrational resonance phenomena in neuronal media, focusing mainly on their emergence in complex networks of neurons as well as in simple network structures that represent local behaviours of neuron communities. From this perspective, we aim to provide a secure guide by including theoretical and experimental approaches that analyse in detail possible reasons and necessary conditions for the appearance of stochastic resonance and vibrational resonance in neural systems.

  abstract = {Introduction: After a hypnotic induction, medium and highly hypnotizable individuals often report spontaneous alterations in various dimensions of consciousness. Few studies investigating these experiences have controlled for the inherent demands of specific hypnotic suggestions and fewer still have considered their dynamic properties and neural correlates. Methods: We adopted a neurophenomenological approach to investigate neutral hypnosis, which involves no specific suggestion other than to go into hypnosis, with 37 individuals of high, medium, and low hypnotizability (Highs, Mediums, and Lows). Their reports of depth and spontaneous experience at baseline, following a hypnotic induction, and then after multiple rest periods were analyzed and related to EEG frequency band power and global functional connectivity. Results: Hypnotizability was marginally associated with lower global functional connectivity during hypnosis. Perceived hypnotic depth increased substantially after the induction especially among Highs and then Mediums, but remained almost unchanged among Lows. In the sample as a whole, depth correlated moderately to strongly with power and/or power heterogeneity for the fast EEG frequencies of beta2, beta3, and gamma, but independently only among Highs. The spontaneous phenomenology of Lows referred primarily to the ongoing experiment and everyday concerns, those of Mediums to vestibular and other bodily experiences, and those of Highs to imagery and positive affect/exceptional experiences. The latter two phenomena were associated with lower global functional connectivity during hypnosis. Imagery correlated positively with gamma power heterogeneity and negatively with alpha1 power heterogeneity. Generally, the pattern of correlations for the Highs was the opposite of that for the Lows. Conclusions: Experienced hypnotic depth and spontaneous phenomena following a neutral hypnotic induction vary as a function of hypnotizability and are related to global functional connectivity and EEG band wave activity. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Language is a uniquely human ability that evolved at some point in the roughly 6,000,000 years since human and chimpanzee lines diverged. Even in the most linguistically impoverished environments, children naturally develop sophisticated language systems. In contrast, reading is a learnt skill that does not develop without intensive tuition and practice. Learning to read is likely to involve ontogenic structural brain changes, but these are nearly impossible to isolate in children owing to concurrent biological, environmental and social maturational changes. In Colombia, guerrillas are re-integrating into mainstream society and learning to read for the first time as adults. This presents a unique opportunity to investigate how literacy changes the brain, without the maturational complications present in children. Here we compare structural brain scans from those who learnt to read as adults (late-literates) with those from a carefully matched set of illiterates. Late-literates had more white matter in the splenium of the corpus callosum and more grey matter in bilateral angular, dorsal occipital, middle temporal, left supramarginal and superior temporal gyri. The importance of these brain regions for skilled reading was investigated in early literates, who learnt to read as children. We found anatomical connections linking the left and right angular and dorsal occipital gyri through the area of the corpus callosum where white matter was higher in late-literates than in illiterates; that reading, relative to object naming, increased the interhemispheric functional connectivity between the left and right angular gyri; and that activation in the left angular gyrus exerts top-down modulation on information flow from the left dorsal occipital gyrus to the left supramarginal gyrus. These findings demonstrate how the regions identified in late-literates interact during reading, relative to object naming, in early literates.},

  abstract = {The term " Monte Carlo " first appeared in an article of 1949 by Metropolis and Ulam 1 . These authors suggested a method to solve a class of problems in Physics and Mathe-matics using a statistical approach. Actually similar ideas, under the name of statistical sampling, were used earlier, much before the invention of computers. A classical example is the so-called problem of the Buffon's needle, named after Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707-1788), a french naturalist and mathe-matician. Buffon considered a needle of length l thrown at random on a plane in which are drawn some parallel long lines separated by a distance t (see Fig. 1). Defining x the position of the center of the needle (0 {$\leq$} x {$\leq$} l) and \texttheta{} the angle formed by the needle with the axis perpendicular to the lines (-{$\pi$}/2 {$\leq$} \texttheta{} {$\leq$} {$\pi$}/2) one can easily find the probability that the needle crosses the lines from P = 2 t{$\pi$} l/2 0 dx arccos(2x/l) - arccos(2x/l) d\texttheta{} = 2l t{$\pi$} 1 0 dy arccos(y) = 2l t{$\pi$} (1) Imagine now to throw the needle N times, and let N * the number of times it crosses the lines. We could estimate the probability as P {$\approx$} N * /N . During the 19th and 20th centuries several people performed the needle experiment to obtain an estimate of the number {$\pi$} as {$\pi$} {$\approx$} 2l t N N * (2) which follows from Eq. (1). Obviously the result becomes more and more accurate as N increases 2 . This calculation is an example of the use of statistical sampling to estimate the double integral appearing in Eq. (1). Usually, up to three dimensions, integrals can be calculated more efficiently using quadrature methods. For high dimensional integrals, however, the Monte Carlo method becomes much more efficient than quadratures. To 1 N. Metropolis and S.

It is therefore obviously worth asking whether purported measures of complexity measure aggregate phenomena, or individual aspects of complexity and if so which. This paper uses a recently developed rigorous framework for understanding complexity to answer this question about measurement. The approach is two-fold: find measures of individual aspects of complexity on the one hand, and explain measures of complexity on the other. We illustrate the conceptual framework of complexity science and how it links the foundations to the practised science with examples from different scientific fields and of various aspects of complexity. Furthermore, we analyse a selection of purported measures of complexity that have found wide application and explain why and how they measure aspects of complexity. This work gives the reader a tool to take any existing measure of complexity and analyse it, and to take any feature of complexity and find the right measure for it.},

If the q neighbors agree, the voter takes their opinion; if they do not have an unanimous opinion, still a voter can flip its state with probability \$\textbackslash epsilon\$. We solve the model on a fully connected network (i.e. in mean-field) and compute the exit probability as well as the average time to reach consensus. We analyze the results in the perspective of a recently proposed Langevin equation aimed at describing generic phase transitions in systems with two (\$Z\_2\$ symmetric) absorbing states. We find that in mean-field the q-voter model exhibits a disordered phase for high \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ and an ordered one for low \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ with three possible ways to go from one to the other: (i) a unique (generalized voter-like) transition, (ii) a series of two consecutive Ising-like and directed percolation transition, and (iii) a series of two transitions, including an intermediate regime in which the final state depends on initial conditions. This third (so far unexplored) scenario, in which a new type of ordering dynamics emerges, is rationalized and found to be specific of mean-field, i.e. fluctuations are explicitly shown to wash it out in spatially extended systems.},

A growing body of evidence that the primary sensory areas are central to conscious processing is inconsistent with conventional bottom-up models of passive sensory transformation. The new paradigm emphasizes the interaction of top-down corticocortical influences with bottom-up sensory feedback. This review develops the new interactive paradigm with respect to the behaviourally relevant N1 component of the somatosensory evoked response in primary somatosensory neocortex which is only observed during conscious states and predicts touch discrimination behaviour. N1 is generated by layer I excitation apparently in response to backward projections from higher order cortical areas. The backward corticocortical projections mediating top-down influences are anatomically concentrated in layer I where they strongly excite the subpopulation of pyramidal neurons with extensive distal apical dendrites. This subpopulation includes the forward-projecting pyramids subserving corticocortical reentrance as well as the corticobulbar projections mediating cortical control over fine sensory-oriented movements. This interactive paradigm views conscious sensation as an active behaviour with the optimal spatial resolution of primary areas serving as the sensory-motor interface at the major convergence point between reentrant bottom-up and top-down pathways. A device is proposed for the reconstruction of cortical sensory processing based upon the central importance of the primary area as the focus of convergent top-down cortical projections.},

  abstract = {Functional neuroimaging studies have started unravelling unexpected functional attributes for the posteromedial portion of the parietal lobe, the precuneus. This cortical area has traditionally received little attention, mainly because of its hidden location and the virtual absence of focal lesion studies. However, recent functional imaging findings in healthy subjects suggest a central role for the precuneus in a wide spectrum of highly integrated tasks, including visuo-spatial imagery, episodic memory retrieval and self-processing operations, namely first-person perspective taking and an experience of agency. Furthermore, precuneus and surrounding posteromedial areas are amongst the brain structures displaying the highest resting metabolic rates (hot spots) and are characterized by transient decreases in the tonic activity during engagement in non-self-referential goal-directed actions (default mode of brain function). Therefore, it has recently been proposed that precuneus is involved in the interwoven network of the neural correlates of self-consciousness, engaged in self-related mental representations during rest. This hypothesis is consistent with the selective hypometabolism in the posteromedial cortex reported in a wide range of altered conscious states, such as sleep, drug-induced anaesthesia and vegetative states. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the macroscopic and microscopic anatomy of precuneus, together with its wide-spread connectivity with both cortical and subcortical structures, as shown by connectional and neurophysiological findings in non-human primates, and links these notions with the multifaceted spectrum of its behavioural correlates. By means of a critical analysis of precuneus activation patterns in response to different mental tasks, this paper provides a useful conceptual framework for matching the functional imaging findings with the specific role(s) played by this structure in the higher-order cognitive functions in which it has been implicated. Specifically, activation patterns appear to converge with anatomical and connectivity data in providing preliminary evidence for a functional subdivision within the precuneus into an anterior region, involved in self-centred mental imagery strategies, and a posterior region, subserving successful episodic memory retrieval.},

  abstract = {Human social interactions in local settings can be experimentally detected by recording the physical proximity and orientation of people. Such interactions, approximating face-to-face communications, can be effectively represented as time varying social networks with links being unceasingly created and destroyed over time. Traditional analyses of temporal networks have addressed mostly pairwise interactions, where links describe dyadic connections among individuals. However, many network dynamics are hardly ascribable to pairwise settings but often comprise larger groups, which are better described by higher-order interactions. Here we investigate the higher-order organizations of temporal social networks by analyzing three publicly available datasets collected in different social settings. We find that higher-order interactions are ubiquitous and, similarly to their pairwise counterparts, characterized by heterogeneous dynamics, with bursty trains of rapidly recurring higher-order events separated by long periods of inactivity. We investigate the evolution and formation of groups by looking at the transition rates between different higher-order structures. We find that in more spontaneous social settings, group are characterized by slower formation and disaggregation, while in work settings these phenomena are more abrupt, possibly reflecting pre-organized social dynamics. Finally, we observe temporal reinforcement suggesting that the longer a group stays together the higher the probability that the same interaction pattern persist in the future. Our findings suggest the importance of considering the higher-order structure of social interactions when investigating human temporal dynamics.},

Once this failure is recognized, the door to further progress is opened. In the second half of the paper, I argue that if we move to a new kind of nonreductive explanation, a naturalistic account of consciousness can be given.

  abstract = {The growing interest of modeling human diseases using genetically modified (transgenic) nonhuman primates (NHPs) is a direct result of NHPs (rhesus macaque, etc.) close relation to humans. NHPs share similar developmental paths with humans in their anatomy, physiology, genetics, and neural functions; and in their cognition, emotion, and social behavior. The NHP model within biomedical research has played an important role in the development of vaccines, assisted reproductive technologies, and new therapies for many diseases. Biomedical research has not been the primary role of NHPs. They have mainly been used for safety evaluation and pharmacokinetics studies, rather than determining therapeutic efficacy. The development of the first transgenic rhesus macaque (2001) revolutionized the role of NHP models in biomedicine. Development of the transgenic NHP model of Huntington's disease (2008), with distinctive clinical features, further suggested the uniqueness of the model system; and the potential role of the NHP model for human genetic disorders. Modeling human genetic diseases using NHPs will continue to thrive because of the latest advances in molecular, genetic, and embryo technologies. NHPs rising role in biomedical research, specifically preclinical studies, is foreseeable. The path toward the development of transgenic NHPs and the prospect of transgenic NHPs in their new role in future biomedicine needs to be reviewed. This article will focus on the advancement of transgenic NHPs in the past decade, including transgenic technologies and disease modeling. It will outline new technologies that may have significant impact in future NHP modeling and will conclude with a discussion of the future prospects of the transgenic NHP model.},

A graph-theoretic framework is used to guide analysis of functional MRI resting-state data and describe systems-level differences in connectivity of individual brain networks. Young adults' brain systems exhibit a balance of within- and between-system correlations that is characteristic of segregated and specialized organization. Increasing age is accom- panied by decreasing segregation of brain systems. Compared with systems involved in the processing of sensory input and mo- tor output, systems mediating ``associative'' operations exhibit a distinct pattern of reductions in segregation across the adult lifespan. Of particular importance, the magnitude of association system segregation is predictive of long-term memory function, independent of an individual's age.},

Then with fast-ICA algorithm, spatially neighboring fMRI data were blindly separated into several temporal courses and were preassumed to be formed by a signal time course and several noise time courses where the signal has the largest correlation coefficient with the reference signal. The final functional imaging was completed for the signals obtained from each voxel. Simulations showed that compared with the spatial ICA method, the new temporal ICA method is more effective than the spatial ICA in detecting weak signal in a fMRI dataset. As background noise, the simulations include simulated Gaussian noise and fMRI data without stimulation. Finally, vivo fMRI tests showed that the excited areas evoked by a visual stimuli are mainly in the region of the primary visual cortex and that evoked by auditory stimuli are mainly in the region of the primary temporal cortex.},

We show that malware can use cloaked computations to hide essential secrets (like the target of an attack) from a malware analyst. We describe and implement a protocol that establishes an encryption key under control of the TPM that can only be used by a specific infection program. An infected host then proves the legitimacy of this key to a remote malware distribution platform, and receives and executes an encrypted payload in a way that prevents software visibility of the decrypted payload. We detail how malware can benefit from cloaked computations and discuss defenses against our protocol. Hardening legitimate uses of the TPM against attack improves the resilience of our malware, creating a Catch-22 for secure computing technology.},

Basically, the measure of independence among demixed signals is maximized to carry out the learning rule for the demixing matrix. In particular, we address the construction of basis vectors of acoustic models using ICA. The independence measure is evaluated to improve an adaptive acoustic model for speaker adaptation in a speech recognition system. Next, the measure of independence is developed based on a hypothesis testing problem. A nonparametric distribution is introduced to avoid Gaussian assumption to realize a meaningful ICA solution. Speech separation and recognition are evaluated. On the other hand, a convex divergence ICA is addressed to carry out a flexible solution to estimating the demixing matrix with a tunable convexity parameter. A new contrast function is derived to measure the independence by employing a general convex function in Jensen's inequality based on the nonparametric distribution. Multichannel signal separation of speech and music is evaluated. In addition, we present the nonstationary source separation to capture the dynamics of mixing conditions in an auditory scene with multiple source signals. Sequential and variational Bayesian learning is implemented to tackle such a complicated mixing system.}

Researchers and institutions have proposed open science practices (OSPs) to improve the detectability of QRPs and the credibility of science. We examine the prevalence of QRPs and OSPs in criminology, and researchers' opinions of those practices. Methods. We administered an anonymous survey to authors of articles published in criminology journals. Respondents self-reported their own use of 10 QRPs and 5 OSPs. They also estimated the prevalence of use by others, and reported their attitudes toward the practices.    Results. QRPs and OSPs are both common in quantitative criminology, about as common as they are in other fields. Criminologists who responded to our survey support using QRPs in some circumstances, but are even more supportive of using OSPs. We did not detect a significant relationship between methodological training and either QRP or OSP use. Support for QRPs is negatively and significantly associated with support for OSPs. Perceived prevalence estimates for some practices resembled a uniform distribution, suggesting criminologists have little knowledge of the proportion of researchers that engage in certain questionable practices. Conclusions. Most quantitative criminologists in our sample use QRPs, and many use multiple QRPs. The substantial prevalence of QRPs raises questions about the validity and reproducibility of published criminological research. We found promising levels of OSP use, albeit at levels lagging what researchers endorse. The findings thus suggest that additional reforms are needed to decrease QRP use and increase the use of OSPs.},

  abstract = {The introduction of lung cancer screening programs will produce an unprecedented amount of chest CT scans in the near future, which radiologists will have to read in order to decide on a patient follow-up strategy. According to the current guidelines, the workup of screen-detected nodules strongly relies on nodule size and nodule type. In this paper, we present a deep learning system based on multi-stream multi-scale convolutional networks, which automatically classifies all nodule types relevant for nodule workup. The system processes raw CT data containing a nodule without the need for any additional information such as nodule segmentation or nodule size and learns a representation of 3D data by analyzing an arbitrary number of 2D views of a given nodule. The deep learning system was trained with data from the Italian MILD screening trial and validated on an independent set of data from the Danish DLCST screening trial. We analyze the advantage of processing nodules at multiple scales with a multi-stream convolutional network architecture, and we show that the proposed deep learning system achieves performance at classifying nodule type that surpasses the one of classical machine learning approaches and is within the inter-observer variability among four experienced human observers.},

  abstract = {Charlie Dunbar Broad was a leading contributor to analytic philosophy of the twenti- eth century, known not so much for any startlingly original doctrines he propounded as for his formidable powers of distinction, analysis, and argument. Born in London, he was educated at Dulwich College and Cambridge. He entered Cambridge in 1905, first studying physics and chemistry in the natural science tripos and then switching to philosophy in the moral science tripos. The influence of Russell and Moore at Cambridge was then very strong and shows itself in Broad's work (see RUSSELL and MOORE). He published his dissertation as Perception, Physics, and Reality in 1914. For a period of years beginning in 1911 he served as G. F. Stout's assistant in St. Andrews, and in 1920 he was appointed professor at the University of Bristol, where he gave the course of lectures in philosophy for natural science students that became Scientific Thought. In 1922 he delivered the Tarner Lectures, subsequently published as The Mind and Its Place in Nature, and was invited to succeed McTaggart as lecturer at Cambridge. After McTaggart's death in 1925, he oversaw the publication of the second volume of McTaggart's The Nature of Existence, which served as the stimulus for writing his own monumental Examination of McTaggart's Philosophy. (This is the book of choice for any metaphysician who is sentenced to exile on a desert island.) From 1933 until his retire- ment in 1953 he was Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy at Cambridge. His other books include Five Types of Ethical Theory (1930) and two collections of papers, Ethics and the History of Philosophy (1952) and Religion, Philosophy, and Psychical Research (1953). After his death his student Casimir Lewy published his courses of lectures on Leibniz and Kant.},

Over the past years, principles of information theory have been applied to many environmental and ecological studies. However, it still appears that the initial concept of entropy as identified by Shannon's initial contribution cannot be directly applied to evolving geographical systems. The research introduced in this paper suggests an extension of the concept of entropy to the spatial and temporal dimensions, by taking into account the distribution of entities in space and time. We propose a series of entropy measures that together form a set of complementary indices to evaluate the distribution of entities, events and categories in space and time. The whole approach is exemplified by several illustrative configurations. \textcopyright{} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Networks have in recent years emerged as an invaluable tool for describing and quantifying complex systems in many branches of science. Recent studies suggest that networks often exhibit hierarchical organization, in which vertices divide into groups that further subdivide into groups of groups, and so forth over multiple scales. In many cases the groups are found to correspond to known functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules in biochemical networks (protein interaction networks, metabolic networks or genetic regulatory networks) or communities in social networks. Here we present a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure from network data and show that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously explain and quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties of networks, such as right-skewed degree distributions, high clustering coefficients and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge of hierarchical structure can be used to predict missing connections in partly known networks with high accuracy, and for more general network structures than competing techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a central organizing principle of complex networks, capable of offering insight into many network phenomena. \textcopyright 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

We introduce an extension of the Hopfield model, able to store multiple spatial maps as continuous, finite-dimensional attractors. The phase diagram and dynamical properties of the model are analyzed. We then show how spatial representations can be dynamically decoded using an effective Ising model capturing the correlation structure in the neural data, and compare applications to data obtained from hippocampal multi-electrode recordings and by (sub)sampling our attractor model. In a second part, we focus on the problem of learning data representations in machine learning, in particular with artificial neural networks. We start by introducing data representations through some illustrations.

  abstract = {This paper is a `spiritual child' of the 2005 lecture notes Kindergarten Quantum Mechanics [23], which showed how a simple, pictorial extension of Dirac notation allowed several quantum features to be easily expressed and derived, using language even a kindergartner can understand. Central to that approach was the use of pictures and pictorial transformation rules to understand and derive features of quantum theory and computation. However, this approach left many wondering `where's the beef?' In other words, was this new approach capable of producing new results, or was it simply an aesthetically pleasing way to restate stuff we already know? The aim of this sequel paper is to say `here's the beef!', and highlight some of the major results of the approach advocated in Kindergarten Quantum Mechanics, and how they are being applied to tackle practical problems on real quantum computers. Toward that end, we will focus mainly on what has become the Swiss army knife of the pictorial formalism: the ZX-calculus, a graphical tool for representing and manipulating complex linear maps on 2N dimensional space. First we look at some of the ideas behind the ZX-calculus, comparing and contrasting it with the usual quantum circuit formalism. We then survey results from the past 2 years falling into three categories: (1) completeness of the rules of the ZX-calculus, (2) state-of-the-art quantum circuit optimisation results in commercial and open-source quantum compilers relying on ZX, and (3) the use of ZX in translating realworld stuff like natural language into quantum circuits that can be run on today's (very limited) quantum hardware.},

Instead, the majority of cognitive neuroscience studies rest on the assumption of functional localization. Although the functional localization approach has brought us a long way toward a basic characterization of brain functional organization, there are methodological and theoretical limitations of this approach. Further advances in our understanding of neurocognitive function may come from examining how the brain performs computations and forms transient functional neural networks using the rich multi-dimensional information available in time. This approach rests on the assumption that information is coded precisely in time but distributed in space; therefore, measures of rapid neuroelectrophysiological dynamics may provide insights into brain function that cannot be revealed using localization-based approaches and assumptions. Space is not an irrelevant dimension for brain organization; rather, a more complete understanding of how brain dynamics lead to behavior dynamics must incorporate how the brain uses time-based coding and processing schemes.},

However, studies have reported discrepant findings, providing a confusing picture. Here we briefly review these studies and conduct simulations to explore the influence of several experimental and physiological factors on correlation measurements. Differences in response strength, the time window over which spikes are counted, spike sorting conventions and internal states can all markedly affect measured correlations and systematically bias estimates. Given these complicating factors, we offer guidelines for interpreting correlation data and a discussion of how best to evaluate the effect of correlations on cortical processing.},

  abstract = {Background: Cooperation is ubiquitous in biological systems, yet its evolution is a long lasting evolutionary problem. A general and intuitive result from theoretical models of cooperative behaviour is that cooperation decreases when its costs are higher, because selfish individuals gain selective advantage. Results: Contrary to this intuition, we show that cooperation can increase with higher costs. We analyse a minimal model where individuals live on a lattice and evolve the degree of cooperation. We find that a feedback establishes between the evolutionary dynamics of public good production and the spatial self-organisation of the population. The evolutionary dynamics lead to the speciation of a cooperative and a selfish lineage. The ensuing spatial self-organisation automatically diversifies the selection pressure on the two lineages. This enables selfish individuals to successfully invade cooperators at the expenses of their autonomous replication, and cooperators to increase public good production while expanding in the empty space left behind by cheaters. We show that this emergent feedback leads to higher degrees of cooperation when costs are higher. Conclusions: An emergent feedback between evolution and self-organisation leads to high degrees of cooperation at high costs, under simple and general conditions. We propose this as a general explanation for the evolution of cooperative behaviours under seemingly prohibitive conditions.},

The key issue is to delimit the phrase 'of a certain kind'. I call this the problem of distinguishing between standard and nonstandard models of computation. The successful drawing of this distinction guards Turing's 1936 analysis of computation against a difficulty that has persistently been raised against it, and undercuts various objections that have been made to the computational theory of mind. \textcopyright{} 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.}

One system, which includes parts of the intraparietal cortex and superior frontal cortex, is involved in preparing and applying goal-directed (top-down) selection for stimuli and responses. This system is also modulated by the detection of stimuli. The other system, which includes the temporoparietal cortex and inferior frontal cortex, and is largely lateralized to the right hemisphere, is not involved in top-down selection. Instead, this system is specialized for the detection of behaviourally relevant stimuli, particularly when they are salient or unexpected. This ventral frontoparietal network works as a 'circuit breaker' for the dorsal system, directing attention to salient events. Both attentional systems interact during normal vision, and both are disrupted in unilateral spatial neglect.},

This "reorienting" response involves the coordinated action of a right hemisphere dominant ventral frontoparietal network that interrupts and resets ongoing activity and a dorsal frontoparietal network specialized for selecting and linking stimuli and responses. At rest, each network is distinct and internally correlated, but when attention is focused, the ventral network is suppressed to prevent reorienting to distracting events. These different patterns of recruitment may reflect inputs to the ventral attention network from the locus coeruleus/norepinephrine system. While originally conceptualized as a system for redirecting attention from one object to another, recent evidence suggests a more general role in switching between networks, which may explain recent evidence of its involvement in functions such as social cognition.},

A fundamental property of networks is that perturbations to one node can affect other nodes, potentially causing the entire system to change behavior or fail. Here, we show that it is possible to exploit the same principle to control network behavior. Our approach accounts for the nonlinear dynamics inherent to real systems, and allows bringing the system to a desired target state even when this state is not directly accessible due to constraints that limit the allowed interventions. Applications show that this framework permits reprogramming a network to a desired task as well as rescuing networks from the brink of failure---which we illustrate through the mitigation of cascading failures in a power-grid network and the identification of potential drug targets in a signaling network of human cancer.},

Based on the process matrix formalism, this framework naturally extends to generalised structures with indefinite causal order.},

Across all types, short latency responses are mostly evoked by L/M-opponent inputs whereas longer latency responses are evoked mostly by S-opponent inputs. Furthermore, neurons with late S-cone inputs exhibit dynamic changes in the sharpness of their chromatic tuning over time. We propose that the sparse, S-opponent signal in the lateral geniculate nucleus is amplified in area V1, possibly through recurrent excitatory networks.

Although the integration of control theory and network analysis is important, we argue that the application of the structural controllability framework to most if not all real-world networks leads to the conclusion that a single control input, applied to the power dominating set (PDS), is all that is needed for structural controllability. This result is consistent with the well-known fact that controllability and its dual observability are generic properties of systems. We argue that more important than issues of structural controllability are the questions of whether a system is almost uncontrollable, whether it is almost unobservable, and whether it possesses almost pole-zero cancellations.},

Depth, therefore, is at root arbitrary. Computational mechanics, an alternative approach to structural complexity, provides a definition for a system's minimal, necessary causal states and a procedure for finding them. We show that the rate of increase in thermodynamic depth, or dive, is the system's reverse-time Shannon entropy rate, and so depth only measures degrees of macroscopic randomness, not structure. To fix this, we redefine the depth in terms of the causal state representation\textemdash{$\epsilon$}-machines\textemdash and show that this representation gives the minimum dive consistent with accurate prediction.

  abstract = {The author is a professor of biochemistry, who studied the weak links between proteins for 15 years, and was intrigued by the unexplained, stress protein-induced stabilization of cells and animal development. When he started to look for an explanation, a strikingly general statement emerged from sporadic data published in various disciplines: weak links stabilize complex systems. This book is to show the exciting consequences of this concept in all areas of science providing a universal key to understand the stability and diversity of networks ranging from the atomic to the planetary level. The author builds on recent advances showing an astonishing identity in the topology of various networks, and shows that weak links play a major role to stabilize most, if not all of them. The initial part of the book gives a concise summary of the structure, dynamics and perturbations of networks. Further chapters raise lots of exciting examples from the role of weak bonds developing macromolecular structures, through the role of weak protein-protein interactions in genetic stability, evolution, aging and cancer, as well as the stabilization of neural networks, social nets, the human language, software systems, town architecture, business organizations, the world-trade web and the whole ecosystem around us by weak links. The book is written to a general audience having a high school science education. Besides a panel of eminent scientists from a broad range of various disciplines and a number of high school student researchers will be asked to read the text and suggest modifications to increase its clarity. However, despite its popular tone, the book will use a sharp logic throughout, and will cite all the key original references proving the concept. The book will synthesize the network-, holistic and dynamism-oriented approaches of the books published recently in the field, and use them to prove and elucidate its take home message: weak links stabilize complex systems.},

In recent years, there has been rapid development and increasing use of technologies for recording from large numbers of neurons, either sequentially or simultaneously. A key question is what scientific insight can be gained by studying a population of recorded neurons beyond studying each neuron individually. Here, we examine three important motivations for population studies: single-trial hypotheses requiring statistical power, hypotheses of population response structure and exploratory analyses of large data sets. Many recent studies have adopted dimensionality reduction to analyze these populations and to find features that are not apparent at the level of individual neurons. We describe the dimensionality reduction methods commonly applied to population activity and offer practical advice about selecting methods and interpreting their outputs. This review is intended for experimental and computational researchers who seek to understand the role dimensionality reduction has had and can have in systems neuroscience, and who seek to apply these methods to their own data.

New mathematical tools, previously unknown in the neuroscience community, are now being used to tackle fundamental questions and analyze emerging data sets. Consistent with this trend, the last decade has seen an uptick in the use of topological ideas and methods in neuroscience. In this talk I will survey recent applications of topology in neuroscience, and explain why topology is an especially natural tool for understanding neural codes.},

Macroscopically, however, they can be efficiently modeled by generalizing concepts of the theory of Markovian, ergodic and weakly interacting stochastic processes. In this paper, we model stochastic processes by a family of generalized Fokker-Planck equations whose stationary solutions are equivalent to the maximum entropy distributions according to generalized entropies. We show that at asymptotically large times and volumes, the scaling exponent of the anomalous diffusion process described by the generalized Fokker-Planck equation and the phase space volume scaling exponent of the generalized entropy bijectively determine each other via a simple algebraic relation. This implies that these basic measures characterizing the transient and the stationary behaviour of the processes provide the same information regarding the asymptotic regime, and consequently, the classification of the processes given by these two exponents coincide.},

These models marry graph and probability theory to visualize, understand, and interpret variables and their relations as nodes and edges in a graph. Many applications of network models rely on undirected graphs in which the absence of an edge between two nodes encodes conditional independence between the corresponding variables. To gauge the importance of nodes in such a network, various node centrality measures have become widely used, especially in psychology and neuroscience. It is intuitive to interpret nodes with high centrality measures as being important in a causal sense. Using the causal framework based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), we show that the relation between causal influence and node centrality measures is not straightforward. In particular, the correlation between causal influence and several node centrality measures is weak, except for eigenvector centrality. Our results provide a cautionary tale: if the underlying real-world system can be modeled as a DAG, but researchers interpret nodes with high centrality as causally important, then this may result in sub-optimal interventions.},

Rarer still are studies on the topological effectiveness of police interventions. Between 2014 and 2016, the Brazilian Federal Police raided a child pornography ring acting inside the dark web. With these data, we build a topic-view network and compare network disruption strategies with the real police work. Only 7.4\% of the forum users share relevant content, and the topological features of this core differ markedly from other clandestine networks. Approximately 60\% of the core users need to be targeted to fully break the network connectivity, while the real effect of the arrests was similar to random failure. Despite this topological robustness, the overall ``viewership network'' was still well disrupted by the arrests, because only 10 users contributed to almost 1/3 of the total post views and 8 of these were apprehended. Moreover, the users who were arrested provided a total of 60\% of the viewed content. These results indicate that for similar online systems, aiming at the users that concentrate the views may lead to more efficient police interventions than focusing on the overall connectivity.},

  abstract = {Optogenetics is a recently developed method in which neurons are genetically modified to express membrane proteins sensitive to light, enabling precisely targeted control of neural activity [1-3]. The temporal and spatial precision afforded by neural stimulation by light holds promise as a powerful alternative to current methods of neural control, which rely predominantly on electrical and pharmacological methods, in both research and clinical settings [4, 5]. Although the optogenetic approach has been widely used in rodent and other small animal models to study neural circuitry [6-8], its functional application in primate models has proven more difficult. In contrast to the relatively large literature on the effects of cortical electrical microstimulation in perceptual and decision-making tasks [9-13], previous studies of optogenetic stimulation in primates have not demonstrated its utility in similar paradigms [14-18]. In this study, we directly compare the effects of optogenetic activation and electrical microstimulation in the lateral intraparietal area during a visuospatial discrimination task. We observed significant and predictable biases in visual attention in response to both forms of stimulation that are consistent with the experimental modulation of a visual salience map. Our results demonstrate the power of optogenetics as a viable alternative to electrical microstimulation for the precise dissection of the cortical pathways of high-level processes in the primate brain. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here, we describe a methodology that we have developed and successfully deployed on a regular basis with multiple monkeys. All devices and accessories are easy to obtain and results using these have been proven to be highly replicable. We developed the "in-chair" viral injection system and used tapered and thinner fibers for optical stimulation, which significantly improved the efficacy and reduced tissue damage. With these methods, we have successfully transduced cells in multiple monkeys in both deep and shallow cortical areas. We could reliably obtain neural modulation for months after injection, and no light-induced artifacts were observed during recordings. Further experiments using these methods have shown that optogenetic stimulation can be used to bias spatial attention in a visual choice discrimination task in a way comparable to electrical microstimulation, which demonstrates the potential use of our methods in both fundamental research and clinical applications.},

  abstract = {Background: The idea that underlying, generative mechanisms give rise to causal regularities has become a guiding principle across many social and natural science disciplines. A specific form of this enquiry, realist evaluation is gaining momentum in the evaluation of complex social interventions. It focuses on 'what works, how, in which conditions and for whom' using context, mechanism and outcome configurations as opposed to asking whether an intervention 'works'. Realist evaluation can be difficult to codify and requires considerable researcher reflection and creativity. As such there is often confusion when operationalising the method in practice. This article aims to clarify and further develop the concept of mechanism in realist evaluation and in doing so aid the learning of those operationalising the methodology. Discussion: Using a social science illustration, we argue that disaggregating the concept of mechanism into its constituent parts helps to understand the difference between the resources offered by the intervention and the ways in which this changes the reasoning of participants. This in turn helps to distinguish between a context and mechanism. The notion of mechanisms 'firing' in social science research is explored, with discussions surrounding how this may stifle researchers' realist thinking. We underline the importance of conceptualising mechanisms as operating on a continuum, rather than as an 'on/off' switch. Summary: The discussions in this article will hopefully progress and operationalise realist methods. This development is likely to occur due to the infancy of the methodology and its recent increased profile and use in social science research. The arguments we present have been tested and are explained throughout the article using a social science illustration, evidencing their usability and value.},

This gives us economies of storage: We do not need to remember that Bill has blue eyes and wavy hair if we can acquire this information by looking at Bill. I argue for a corollary to this position, which I call 'internalism.' Internalism says we can acquire knowledge on a need-to-know basis by consulting portable, inner analogues of the world. This, however, leads to a dilemma. If the knowledge was stored in memory, it is difficult to see how we could have acquired it by consulting inner analogues, for it would seem that we knew it already. Moreover, if it was stored in memory, we lose the economies of storage that provide much of the rationale for external memory stores and hence for their inner analogues. If, on the other hand, the knowledge was not stored in memory, it is difficult to see how we could have acquired it by consulting inner analogues, for it was not there to be acquired. I propose a solution to this problem that turns on the concept of nonconceptual content, and I relate the solution to Stephen Kosslyn's (1994) architecture of perception and visual mental imagery. Viewed in a broader context, the solution shows that the world leaks into the mind, as well as mind leaking into the world.},

Here we describe a new pathway that specifically affects the formation of basal dendrites and axonal projections in cortical pyramidal neurons. We report that thousand-and-one-amino acid 2 kinase (TAOK2), also known as TAO2, is essential for dendrite morphogenesis. TAOK2 downregulation impairs basal dendrite formation in vivo without affecting apical dendrites. Moreover, TAOK2 interacts with Neuropilin 1 (Nrp1), a receptor protein that binds the secreted guidance cue Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A). TAOK2 overexpression restores dendrite formation in cultured cortical neurons from Nrp1(Sema-) mice, which express Nrp1 receptors incapable of binding Sema3A. TAOK2 overexpression also ameliorates the basal dendrite impairment resulting from Nrp1 downregulation in vivo. Finally, Sema3A and TAOK2 modulate the formation of basal dendrites through the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). These results delineate a pathway whereby Sema3A and Nrp1 transduce signals through TAOK2 and JNK to regulate basal dendrite development in cortical neurons.},

Basically, an original network is supposed to be transmitted, with or without compaction, through a sequence of symbols or time-series obtained by sampling its topology by some network dynamics, such as random walks. We show that the degree of compression is ultimately related to the ability to predict the frequency of symbols based on the topology of the original network and the adopted dynamics. The potential of the proposed approach is illustrated with respect to the efficiency of transmitting several types of topologies by using a variety of random walks. Several interesting results are obtained, including the behavior of the Barab\'asi\textendash Albert model oscillating between high and low performance depending on the considered dynamics, and the distinct performances obtained for two geographical models.},

  abstract = {Neuroscience is contributing to an understanding of the biological bases of human intelligence differences. This work is principally being conducted along two empirical fronts: genetics--quantitative and molecular--and brain imaging. Quantitative genetic studies have established that there are additive genetic contributions to different aspects of cognitive ability--especially general intelligence--and how they change through the lifespan. Molecular genetic studies have yet to identify reliably reproducible contributions from individual genes. Structural and functional brain-imaging studies have identified differences in brain pathways, especially parieto-frontal pathways, that contribute to intelligence differences. There is also evidence that brain efficiency correlates positively with intelligence.},

  abstract = {Resting state networks (RSNs) show a surprisingly coherent and robust spatiotemporal organization. Previous theoretical studies demonstrated that these patterns can be understood as emergent on the basis of the underlying neuroanatomical connectivity skeleton. Integrating the biologically realistic DTI/DSI-(Diffusion Tensor Imaging/Diffusion Spectrum Imaging)based neuroanatomical connectivity into a brain model of Ising spin dynamics, we found a system with multiple attractors, which can be studied analytically. The multistable attractor landscape thus defines a functionally meaningful dynamic repertoire of the brain network that is inherently present in the neuroanatomical connectivity. We demonstrate that the more entropy of attractors exists, the richer is the dynamical repertoire and consequently the brain network displays more capabilities of computation. We hypothesize therefore that human brain connectivity developed a scale free type of architecture in order to be able to store a large number of different and flexibly accessible brain functions.},

  abstract = {Any physical system can be viewed from the perspective that information is implicitly represented in its state. However, the quantification of this information when it comes to complex networks has remained largely elusive. In this work, we use techniques inspired by quantum statistical mechanics to define an entropy measure for complex networks and to develop a set of information-theoretic tools, based on network spectral properties, such as Renyi q-entropy, generalized Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergences, the latter allowing us to define a natural distance measure between complex networks. First we show that by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between an observed network and a parametric network model, inference of model parameter(s) by means of maximum-likelihood estimation can be achieved and model selection can be performed appropriate information criteria. Second, we show that the information-theoretic metric quantifies the distance between pairs of networks and we can use it, for instance, to cluster the layers of a multilayer system. By applying this framework to networks corresponding to sites of the human microbiome, we perform hierarchical cluster analysis and recover with high accuracy existing community-based associations. Our results imply that spectral based statistical inference in complex networks results in demonstrably superior performance as well as a conceptual backbone, filling a gap towards a network information theory.},

In genetically predisposed individuals, an imbalance in this binary control mechanism can introduce a bias towards stress-related brain disease after adverse experiences.

We tackled this challenge by developing human DNA MiniPromoters using computational biology and phylogenetic conservation. MiniPromoters were tested in mouse as single-copy knock-ins at the Hprt locus on the X Chromosome, and evaluated for lacZ reporter expression in CNS and non-CNS tissue. Eighteen novel MiniPromoters driving expression in mouse brain were identified, two MiniPromoters for driving pan-neuronal expression, and 17 MiniPromoters for the mouse eye. Key areas of therapeutic interest were represented in this set: the cerebral cortex, embryonic hypothalamus, spinal cord, bipolar and ganglion cells of the retina, and skeletal muscle. We also demonstrated that three retinal ganglion cell MiniPromoters exhibit similar cell-type specificity when delivered via adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors intravitreally. We conclude that our methodology and characterization has resulted in desirable expression characteristics that are intrinsic to the MiniPromoter, not dictated by copy number effects or genomic location, and results in constructs predisposed to success in AAV. These MiniPromoters are immediately applicable for pre-clinical studies towards gene therapy in humans, and are publicly available to facilitate basic and clinical research, and human gene therapy.},

  abstract = {Both perceptual inference and motor responses are shaped by learned probabilities. For example, stimulus-induced responses in sensory cortices and preparatory activity in premotor cortex reflect how (un)expected a stimulus is. This is in accordance with predictive coding accounts of brain function, which posit a fundamental role of prediction errors for learning and adaptive behavior. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and recent advances in computational modeling to investigate how (failures of) learned predictions about visual stimuli influence subsequent motor responses. Healthy volunteers discriminated visual stimuli that were differentially predicted by auditory cues. Critically, the predictive strengths of cues varied over time, requiring subjects to continuously update estimates of stimulus probabilities. This online inference, modeled using a hierarchical Bayesian learner, was reflected behaviorally: speed and accuracy of motor responses increased significantly with predictability of the stimuli. We used nonlinear dynamic causal modeling to demonstrate that striatal prediction errors are used to tune functional coupling in cortical networks during learning. Specifically, the degree of striatal trial-by-trial prediction error activity controls the efficacy of visuomotor connections and thus the influence of surprising stimuli on premotor activity. This finding substantially advances our understanding of striatal function and provides direct empirical evidence for formal learning theories that posit a central role for prediction error-dependent plasticity.},

The motivation for doing so is a general concern about the role played by proper functions in Piccinini's account, which will be evaluated in the first part of the paper. I will then propose a potential alternative approach, where computing mechanisms are understood in terms of Carl Craver's perspectival account of mechanistic functions. According to this approach, the mechanistic function of `performing a computation' can only be attributed relative to an explanatory perspective, but such attributions are nonetheless constrained by the underlying physical structure of the system in question, thus avoiding unlimited pancomputationalism. If successful, this approach would carry with it fewer controversial assumptions than Piccinini's original account, which requires a robust understanding of proper functions. Insofar as there are outstanding concerns about the status of proper functions, this approach would therefore be more generally acceptable.},

Trait impulsivity is an important determinant of drug use during development, and in adults momentary 'state' increases in impulsive behavior may increase the likelihood of drug use, especially in individuals attempting to abstain. Conversely, acute and chronic effects of drug use may increase impulsive behaviors, which may in turn facilitate further drug use. However, these effects depend on the behavioral measure used to assess impulsivity. This article reviews data from controlled studies investigating different measures of impulsive behaviors, including delay discounting, behavioral inhibition and a newly proposed measure of inattention. Our findings support the hypothesis that drugs of abuse alter performance across independent behavioral measures of impulsivity. The findings lay the groundwork for studying the cognitive and neurobiological substrates of impulsivity, and for future studies on the role of impulsive behavior as both facilitator and a result of drug use.},

However, despite numerous studies demonstrating that contextual information facilitates both syntactic and lexical-semantic processing, there exists no direct evidence pertaining to the neural correlates of the prediction process itself. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), this study found that brain activity was modulated by whether or not a specific noun could be predicted, given a picture prime. Specifically, before the noun was presented, predictive contexts triggered enhanced activation in left mid-temporal cortex (implicated in lexical access), ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (previously associated with top-down processing), and visual cortex (hypothesized to index the preactivation of predicted form features), successively. This finding suggests that predictive language processing recruits a top-down network where predicted words are activated at different levels of representation, from more 'abstract' lexical-semantic representations in temporal cortex, all the way down to visual word form features. The same brain regions that exhibited enhanced activation for predictive contexts before the onset of the noun showed effects of congruence during the target word. To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to directly investigate the anticipatory stage of predictive language processing. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Patients suffering from schizophrenia are less susceptible to various visual illusions. For example, healthy participants perceive a hollow mask as a normal face, presumably due to the strength of constraining top-down influences, while patients with schizophrenia do not (Schneider, U., Leweke, F.M., Sternemann, U., Weber, M.M., Emrich, H.M., 1996. Visual 3D illusion: a systems-theoretical approach to psychosis. Eur. Arch. Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 246, 256-260; Scheider, U., Borsutzky, M., Seifert, J., Leweke, F.M., Huber, T.J., Rollnik J.D., Emrich, H.M., 2002. Reduced binocular depth inversion in schizophrenic patients.

Towards a cannabinoid hypothesis of schizophrenia: cognitive impairments due to a dysregulation of the endogenous cannabinoid system. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 56, 803-807). However the neural mechanisms underpinning this effect remain poorly understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the hollow-mask illusion in schizophrenic patients and healthy controls. The primary aim of this study was to use measures of effective connectivity arising from dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to explain differences in both the perception of the hollow-mask illusion and associated differences in neural responses between patients with schizophrenia and controls, which we hypothesised would be associated with difference in the influences of top-down and bottom-up processes between the groups. Consistent with this explanation, we identified differences between the two groups in effective connectivity. In particular, there was a strengthening of bottom-up processes, and weakening of top-down ones, during the presentation of 'hollow' faces for the patients. In contrast, the controls exhibited a strengthening of top-down processes when perceiving the same stimuli. These findings suggest that schizophrenic patients rely on stimulus-driven processing and are less able to employ conceptually-driven top-down strategies during perception, where incoming sensory data are constrained with reference to a generative model that entails stored information from past experience.},

In our experiment, we use the hollow-mask illusion to investigate the strength of top-down processes in schizophrenic patients and healthy controls. By using dynamic causal modelling (DCM) on functional magnetic resonance tomography (fMRI) data, we have presented evidence to suggest that patients with schizophrenia are less constrained by top-down processes during perception (Dima, D., Roiser, J.P., Dietrich, D.E., Bonnemann, C., Lanfermann, H., Emrich, H.M., Dillo, W., 2009.

In this study, we re-address this issue by using DCM on event-related potentials (ERPs) data. Our aim was to validate our previous findings by conducting the same connectivity analysis--DCM--on data obtained from a different neuroimaging method. Our results confirm our initial hypothesis that top-down influences are constrained in schizophrenia, especially in perceptual tasks that require top-down control, like the hollow-mask illusion.},

This insusceptibility to the illusion is indicating a weakened top-down processing in schizophrenia and little is understood about the neurobiology of this phenomenon. We used event-related potentials to investigate the hollow-mask illusion in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We hypothesized that there would be a visible reduction of top-down processing in the patients' group and that this reduction would occur in the late stages of processing. We found significantly decreased amplitudes in the P300 and P600 components in the patients' group, indicating that visual information does not benefit from frontal, parietal or temporal activity for perceiving incoming stimuli.

By contrast, the linkage of such representations by integrative functions such as decision-making is mediated by long-range cortical interactions, which yield more diverse local oscillation patterns often involving the beta range. This framework reconciles different cortical oscillation patterns observed in recent studies and helps to understand the link between cortical oscillations and the fMRI signal. Our framework highlights the notion that cortical oscillations index the specific circuit-level mechanisms of cognition.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous recordings from large neural populations are becoming increasingly common. An important feature of population activity is the trial-to-trial correlated fluctuation of spike train outputs from recorded neuron pairs. Similar to the firing rate of single neurons, correlated activity can be modulated by a number of factors, from changes in arousal and attentional state to learning and task engagement. However, the physiological mechanisms that underlie these changes are not fully understood. We review recent theoretical results that identify three separate mechanisms that modulate spike train correlations: changes in input correlations, internal fluctuations and the transfer function of single neurons. We first examine these mechanisms in feedforward pathways and then show how the same approach can explain the modulation of correlations in recurrent networks. Such mechanistic constraints on the modulation of population activity will be important in statistical analyses of high-dimensional neural data.},

However, no randomized controlled trials of DBS for TRD have been published. Methods Thirty patients with TRD participated in a sham-controlled trial of DBS at the ventral capsule/ventral striatum target for TRD. Patients were randomized to active versus sham DBS treatment in a blinded fashion for 16 weeks, followed by an open-label continuation phase. The primary outcome measure was response, defined as a 50\% or greater improvement on the Montgomery-\AA sberg Depression Rating Scale from baseline. Results There was no significant difference in response rates between the active (3 of 15 subjects; 20\%) and control (2 of 14 subjects; 14.3\%) treatment arms and no significant difference between change in Montgomery-\AA sberg Depression Rating Scale scores as a continuous measure upon completion of the 16-week controlled phase of the trial. The response rates at 12, 18, and 24 months during the open-label continuation phase were 20\%, 26.7\%, and 23.3\%, respectively. Conclusion The results of this first randomized controlled study of DBS for the treatment of TRD did not demonstrate a significant difference in response rates between the active and control groups at the end of the 16-week controlled phase. However, a range of 20\% to 26.7\% of patients did achieve response at any time during the open-label continuation phase. Future studies, perhaps utilizing alternative study designs and stimulation parameters, are needed.},

  abstract = {During the decline to extinction, animal populations may present dynamical phenomena not exhibited by robust populations. Some of these phenomena, such as the scaling of demographic variance, are related to small size whereas others result from density-dependent nonlinearities. Although understanding the causes of population extinction has been a central problem in theoretical biology for decades, the ability to anticipate extinction has remained elusive. Here we argue that the causes of a population's decline are central to the predictability of its extinction. Specifically, environmental degradation may cause a tipping point in population dynamics, corresponding to a bifurcation in the underlying population growth equations, beyond which decline to extinction is almost certain. In such cases, imminent extinction will be signalled by critical slowing down (CSD). We conducted an experiment with replicate laboratory populations of Daphnia magna to test this hypothesis. We show that populations crossing a transcritical bifurcation, experimentally induced by the controlled decline in environmental conditions, show statistical signatures of CSD after the onset of environmental deterioration and before the critical transition. Populations in constant environments did not have these patterns. Four statistical indicators all showed evidence of the approaching bifurcation as early as 110 days ({$\sim$}8 generations) before the transition occurred. Two composite indices improved predictability, and comparative analysis showed that early warning signals based solely on observations in deteriorating environments without reference populations for standardization were hampered by the presence of transient dynamics before the onset of deterioration, pointing to the importance of reliable baseline data before environmental deterioration begins. The universality of bifurcations in models of population dynamics suggests that this phenomenon should be general.}

The second part studies models of coevolution, including evolutionary game theory, kin selection, group selection, sexual selection, speciation, and coevolution of hosts and parasites.

Understanding the impact of weight-connectivity correlations on epidemic spreading in weighted networks is crucial to support decision-making on disease control and other diffusive processes. However, a real understanding of epidemic spreading velocity in weighted networks is still lacking. Here we conduct a numerical study of the velocity of a Reed-Frost epidemic spreading process in various weighted network topologies as a function of the correlations between edge weights and node degrees. We find that a positive weight-connectivity correlation leads to a faster epidemic spreading compared to an unweighted network. In contrast, we find that both uncorrelated and negatively correlated weight distributions lead to slower spreading processes. In the case of positive weight-connectivity correlations, the acceleration of spreading velocity is weak when the heterogeneity of weight distribution increases.},

  abstract = {Genetic mutations of SHANK3 have been reported in patients with intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. At the synapse, Shank3/ProSAP2 is a scaffolding protein that connects glutamate receptors to the actin cytoskeleton via a chain of intermediary elements. Although genetic studies have repeatedly confirmed the association of SHANK3 mutations with susceptibility to psychiatric disorders, very little is known about the neuronal consequences of these mutations. Here, we report the functional effects of two de novo mutations (STOP and Q321R) and two inherited variations (R12C and R300C) identified in patients with ASD. We show that Shank3 is located at the tip of actin filaments and enhances its polymerization. Shank3 also participates in growth cone motility in developing neurons. The truncating mutation (STOP) strongly affects the development and morphology of dendritic spines, reduces synaptic transmission in mature neurons and also inhibits the effect of Shank3 on growth cone motility. The de novo mutation in the ankyrin domain (Q321R) modifies the roles of Shank3 in spine induction and morphology, and actin accumulation in spines and affects growth cone motility. Finally, the two inherited mutations (R12C and R300C) have intermediate effects on spine density and synaptic transmission. Therefore, although inherited by healthy parents, the functional effects of these mutations strongly suggest that they could represent risk factors for ASD. Altogether, these data provide new insights into the synaptic alterations caused by SHANK3 mutations in humans and provide a robust cellular readout for the development of knowledge-based therapies.},

  abstract = {Neural responses are most often characterized in terms of the sets of environmental or internal conditions or stimuli with which their firing rate [corrected]increases or decreases are correlated [corrected] Their transient (nonstationary) temporal profiles of activity have received comparatively less attention. Similarly, the computational framework of attractor neural networks puts most emphasis on the representational or computational properties of the stable states of a neural system. Here we review a couple of neurophysiological observations and computational ideas that shift the focus to the transient dynamics of neural systems. We argue that there are many situations in which the transient neural behaviour, while hopping between different attractor states or moving along 'attractor ruins', carries most of the computational and/or behavioural significance, rather than the attractor states eventually reached. Such transients may be related to the computation of temporally precise predictions or the probabilistic transitions among choice options, accounting for Weber's law in decision-making tasks. Finally, we conclude with a more general perspective on the role of transient dynamics in the brain, promoting the view that brain activity is characterized by a high-dimensional chaotic ground state from which transient spatiotemporal patterns (metastable states) briefly emerge. Neural computation has to exploit the itinerant dynamics between these states.},

  abstract = {This thesis analyses the conception and measurement of complexity and then applies it to some aspects of formal languages. It starts with a review of the philosophy of modelling. It continues by considering some simple examples to establish intuitions about the common use of `complexity' and goes on to examine what complexity can usefully be attributed to as a property. It argues that it most useful as an attribute of the specification of a model. Some unsatisfactory accounts of complexity are discussed as motivation for the definition of complexity that is then suggested. Some other accounts of complexity are shown to be special cases of the one suggested here. This approach is then applied to formal languages. A set of properties of analytic complexity are set-out. The set of measures which satisfy these properties is formally investigated. The cyclomatic number of a representation of expressions is put forward to model analytic complexity. In order to analyse shifts in complexity a formal device called syntactic structures is defined. This consists of layers of syntaxes, each with its own production rules which generate the contents of that layer. Each syntactic structure can use substitutions from lower such structures, so that collections of such structures can form hierarchies. These approaches to are then applied to axiomatic and proof theoretic aspects of logic. Some potential methods of simplification are suggested. Finally some remarks are made about the philosophical applications of this approach. The appendices include a survey of measures of complexity in the literature; a brief description of a software tool written to explore syntactic structures, two relevant papers on the application of these ideas to scientific modelling and economics, and an extensive bibliography.},

Such analyses can provide deep insights into the functionality of such systems, as well as a rigid mathematical theory and quantitative measures of information processing in both healthy and diseased states of neural systems. This chapter will present a short introduction to the fundamentals of information theory, especially suited for people having a less firm background in mathematics and probability theory. To begin, the fundamentals of probability theory such as the notion of probability, probability distributions, and random variables will be reviewed. Then, the concepts of information and entropy (in the sense of Shannon), mutual information, and transfer entropy (sometimes also referred to as conditional mutual information) will be outlined. As these quantities cannot be computed exactly from measured data in practice, estimation techniques for information-theoretic quantities will be presented. The chapter will conclude with the applications of information theory in the field of neuroscience, including questions of possible medical applications and a short review of software packages that can be used for information-theoretic analyses of neural data.},

METHOD: Here, we review evidence from animal models of TSC for the role of specific molecular and cellular processes in the pathogenesis of cognitive, developmental and epilepsy-related manifestations seen in the disorder. RESULTS: Recent evidence shows that, in animal models, disinhibited mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling substantially contributes to neuropsychiatric phenotypes, including cognitive deficits and seizures. We discuss potential pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the cognitive phenotypes of TSC and present implications regarding mTOR inhibitor-based treatments for TSC-related neuropsychiatric features. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that reversing the underlying molecular deficits of TSC with rapamycin or other mTOR inhibitors could result in clinically significant improvements of cognitive function and neurological symptoms, even if treatments are started in adulthood.},

Furthermore, we investigate the statistical properties of the DTF and establish a simple significance level for testing for the null hypothesis of no information flow.},

Progress on this front has been accelerated by the new tools of optogenetics and chemogenetics, which provide an unprecedented level of control over distinct neuronal types in small animals. In primates, however, targeting specific types of neurons with these tools remains challenging. In this review, we discuss existing and emerging strategies for directing genetic manipulations to targeted neurons in the adult primate central nervous system. We review the literature on viral vectors for gene delivery to neurons, focusing on adeno-associated viral vectors and lentiviral vectors, their tropism for different cell types, and prospects for new variants with improved efficacy and selectivity. We discuss two projection targeting approaches for probing neural circuits: anterograde projection targeting and retrograde transport of viral vectors. We conclude with an analysis of cell type-specific promoters and other nucleotide sequences that can be used in viral vectors to target neuronal types at the transcriptional level.},

Among college graduates, families headed by someone who completed a postgraduate degree fare even better on these and other measures than families with a head with only a bachelor's degree (Table 1, Panel B). The fact that an increasing share of the adult population is completing four years or more of college suggests a widespread belief that college is, indeed, worth it (Figure 1). Yet signs have emerged that the economic benefits of college may be diminishing. Despite large income and wealth advantages enjoyed on average by families with a head with a bach-elor's degree or higher over families with a head without a postsecondary degree, recent cohorts of college graduates appear to be faring less well than previous generations. 1 The college income premium is the extra income earned by a family whose head has a college degree over the income earned by an otherwise similar family whose head does not have a college degree. This premium remains positive but has declined for recent graduates. The college wealth premium (extra net worth) has declined more noticeably among all cohorts born after 1940. Among families whose head is White and born in the 1980s, the college wealth premium of a terminal four-year bache-lor's degree is at a historic low; among families whose head is any other race and ethnicity born in that decade, the premium is statistically indistinguishable from zero. Among families whose head is of any race or ethnicity born in the 1980s and holding a postgraduate degree, the wealth premium is also indistinguishable from zero. Our results suggest that college and postgraduate education may be failing some recent graduates as a financial investment. (JEL I26 J15) Federal Reserve Bank of St.}

Coherence among subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations could be exploited to express selective functional relationships during states of expectancy or attention, and these dynamic patterns could allow the grouping and selection of distributed neuronal responses for further processing.},

  abstract = {The ability to categorize stimuli into discrete behaviourally relevant groups is an essential cognitive function. To elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying categorization, we constructed a cortical circuit model that is capable of learning a motion categorization task through reward-dependent plasticity. Here we show that stable category representations develop in neurons intermediate to sensory and decision layers if they exhibit choice-correlated activity fluctuations (choice probability). In the model, choice probability and task-specific interneuronal correlations emerge from plasticity of top-down projections from decision neurons. Specific model predictions are confirmed by analysis of single-neuron activity from the monkey parietal cortex, which reveals a mixture of directional and categorical tuning, and a positive correlation between category selectivity and choice probability. Beyond demonstrating a circuit mechanism for categorization, the present work suggests a key role of plastic top-down feedback in simultaneously shaping both neural tuning and correlated neural variability.},

The GGM can highlight potential causal relationships between observed variables---psychological dynamics---in addition to showing which variables predict one-another. We describe the utility in 3 kinds of psychological datasets: datasets in which consecutive cases are assumed independent (e.g., cross-sectional data), temporally ordered datasets (e.g., n = 1 time series), and a mixture of the 2 (e.g., n {$>$} 1 time series). In time-series analysis, the GGM can be used to model the residual structure of a vector-autoregression analysis (VAR), also termed graphical VAR. Two network models can then be obtained: a temporal network and a contemporaneous network. When analyzing data from multiple subjects, a GGM can also be formed on the covariance structure of stationary means---the between-subjects network. We discuss the interpretation of these models and propose estimation methods to obtain these networks, which we implement in the R packages graphicalVAR and mlVAR. The methods are showcased in two empirical examples, and simulation studies on these methods are included in the supplementary materials.},

We describe how regularization techniques can be used to efficiently estimate a parsimonious and interpretable network structure in psychological data. We show how to perform these analyses in R and demonstrate the method in an empirical example on post-traumatic stress disorder data. In addition, we discuss the effect of the hyperparameter that needs to be manually set by the researcher, how to handle non-normal data, how to determine the required sample size for a network analysis, and provide a checklist with potential solutions for problems that can arise when estimating regularized partial correlation networks.},

These network models often contain significant numbers of unknown parameters, yet the sample sizes available in psychological research are limited. As such, general assumptions about the true network are introduced to reduce the number of free parameters. Incorporating these assumptions, however, means that the resulting network will lead to reflect the particular structure assumed by the estimation method---a crucial and often ignored aspect of psychopathological networks. For example, observing a sparse structure and simultaneously assuming a sparse structure does not imply that the true model is, in fact, sparse. To illustrate this point, we discuss recent literature and show the effect of the assumption of sparsity in three simulation studies.},

  abstract = {The usage of psychological networks that conceptualize psychological behavior as a complex interplay of psychological and other components has gained increasing popularity in various fields of psychology. While prior publications have tackled the topics of estimating and interpreting such networks, little work has been conducted to check how accurate (i.e., prone to sampling variation) networks are estimated, and how stable (i.e., interpretation remains similar with less observations) inferences from the network structure (such as centrality indices) are. In this tutorial paper, we aim to introduce the reader to this field and tackle the problem of accuracy under sampling variation. We first introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we provide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of psychological networks. Third, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to (A) assess the accuracy of estimated network connections, (B) investigate the stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections and centrality estimates for different variables differ from each other. We introduce two novel statistical methods: for (B) the correlation stability coefficient, and for (C) the bootstrapped difference test for edge-weights and centrality indices. We conducted and present simulation studies to assess the performance of both methods. Finally, we developed the free R-package bootnet that allows for estimating psychological networks in a generalized framework in addition to the proposed bootstrap methods. We showcase bootnet in a tutorial, accompanied by R syntax, in which we analyze a dataset of 359 women with posttraumatic stress disorder available online.},

Determining the factors that influence individual variation in the magnitude and rate of hippocampal decay may help promote lifestyle changes that prevent such deterioration from taking place. Aerobic fitness and exercise are effective at preventing cortical decay and cognitive impairment in older adults and epidemiological studies suggest that physical activity can reduce the risk for developing dementia. However, the relationship between aerobic fitness and hippocampal volume in elderly humans is unknown. In this study, we investigated whether individuals with higher levels of aerobic fitness displayed greater volume of the hippocampus and better spatial memory performance than individuals with lower fitness levels. Furthermore, in exploratory analyses, we assessed whether hippocampal volume mediated the relationship between fitness and spatial memory. Using a region-of-interest analysis on magnetic resonance images in 165 nondemented older adults, we found a triple association such that higher fitness levels were associated with larger left and right hippocampi after controlling for age, sex, and years of education, and larger hippocampi and higher fitness levels were correlated with better spatial memory performance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that hippocampal volume partially mediated the relationship between higher fitness levels and enhanced spatial memory. Our results clearly indicate that higher levels of aerobic fitness are associated with increased hippocampal volume in older humans, which translates to better memory function.},

In rodents, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes the growth and proliferation of cells in the hippocampus and is important in long-term potentiation and memory formation. In humans, circulating levels of BDNF decline with advancing age, and a genetic polymorphism for BDNF has been related to gray matter volume loss in old age. In this study, we tested whether age-related reductions in serum levels of BDNF would be related to shrinkage of the hippocampus and memory deficits in older adults. Hippocampal volume was acquired by automated segmentation of magnetic resonance images in 142 older adults without dementia. The caudate nucleus was also segmented and examined in relation to levels of serum BDNF. Spatial memory was tested using a paradigm in which memory load was parametrically increased. We found that increasing age was associated with smaller hippocampal volumes, reduced levels of serum BDNF, and poorer memory performance. Lower levels of BDNF were associated with smaller hippocampi and poorer memory, even when controlling for the variation related to age. In an exploratory mediation analysis, hippocampal volume mediated the age-related decline in spatial memory and BDNF mediated the age-related decline in hippocampal volume. Caudate nucleus volume was unrelated to BDNF levels or spatial memory performance. Our results identify serum BDNF as a significant factor related to hippocampal shrinkage and memory decline in late adulthood.},

Exercise training increased hippocampal volume by 2\%, effectively reversing age-related loss in volume by 1 to 2 y. We also demonstrate that increased hippocampal volume is associated with greater serum levels of BDNF, a mediator of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. Hippocampal volume declined in the control group, but higher preintervention fitness partially attenuated the decline, suggesting that fitness protects against volume loss. Caudate nucleus and thalamus volumes were unaffected by the intervention. These theoretically important findings indicate that aerobic exercise training is effective at reversing hippocampal volume loss in late adulthood, which is accompanied by improved memory function.},

Although there are multiple paths by which hippocampal deterioration occurs in late life, the authors discuss the evidence that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene and age-related changes in BDNF protein or receptor expression contribute to hippocampal atrophy. The authors conclude that few studies have tested whether BDNF mediates age-related hippocampal atrophy and memory impairment. However, there is strong evidence that decreased BDNF is associated with age-related hippocampal dysfunction, memory impairment, and increased risk for depression, whereas increasing BDNF by aerobic exercise appears to ameliorate hippocampal atrophy, improve memory function, and reduce depression. Importantly, the most consistent associations between BDNF and hippocampal dysfunction have emerged from research on BDNF protein expression in rodents and serum and plasma concentrations of BDNF in humans. Current research suggests that the BDNF val66met polymorphism may be only weakly associated with hippocampal atrophy in late adulthood. These conclusions are interpreted in relation to age-related memory impairment and preventions for hippocampal atrophy.},

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure.

However, it is uncertain whether the contribution of CA3 is restricted to spatial information, and it is unclear whether CA1 encodes order per se or contributes by an active maintenance of memories of sequential events. Here, we developed a new behavioral task that examines memory for the order of sequential nonspatial events presented as trial-unique odor pairings. When the interval between odors within a studied pair was brief (3 sec), bilateral dorsal CA3 lesions severely disrupted memory for their order, whereas dorsal CA1 lesions did not affect performance. However, when the inter-item interval was extended to 10 sec, CA1 lesions, as well as CA3 lesions, severely disrupted performance. These findings suggest that the role of CA3 in sequence memory is not limited to spatial information, but rather appears to be a fundamental property of CA3 function. In contrast, CA1 becomes involved when memories for events must be held or sequenced over long intervals. Thus, CA3 and CA1 are both involved in memory for sequential nonspatial events that compose unique experiences, and these areas play different roles that are distinguished by the duration of time that must be bridged between key events.},

  abstract = {We compare and contrast three different, but complementary views of "structure" and "pattern" in spatial processes. For definiteness and analytical clarity we apply all three approaches to the simplest class of spatial processes: one-dimensional Ising spin systems with finite-range interactions. These noncritical systems are well suited for this study since the change in structure as a function of system parameters is more subtle than that found in critical systems where, at a phase transition, many observables diverge thereby making the detection of change in structure obvious. This survey demonstrates that the measures of pattern from information theory and computational mechanics differ from known thermodynamic and statistical mechanical functions. Moreover, they capture important structural features that are otherwise missed. In particular, a type of mutual information called the excess entropy-an information-theoretic measure of memory-serves to detect ordered, low-entropy density patterns. It is superior in many respects to other functions used to probe the structure of a configuration distribution, such as magnetization and structure factors. epsilon-Machines-the main objects of computational mechanics-are seen to be the most direct approach to revealing the (group and semigroup) symmetries possessed by the spatial patterns and to estimating the minimum amount of memory required to reproduce the configuration ensemble, a quantity known as the statistical complexity. Finally, we argue that the information-theoretic and computational mechanical analyses of spatial patterns capture the intrinsic computational capabilities in spin systems-how they store, transmit, and manipulate configurational information to produce spatial structure.}

Recently, L\`opez-Ruiz, Mancini, and Calbet [Phys. Lett. A 209 (1995) 321] introduced another measure of statistical complexity CLMC that, like others, satisfies the "boundary conditions" of vanishing in the extreme ordered and disordered limits. We examine some properties of CLMC and find that it is neither an intensive nor an extensive thermodynamic variable and that it vanishes exponentially in the thermodynamic limit for all one-dimensional finite-range spin systems. We propose a simple alteration of CLMC that renders it extensive. However, this remedy results in a quantity that is a trivial function of the entropy density and hence of no use as a measure of structure or memory. We conclude by suggesting that a useful "statistical complexity" must not only obey the ordered-random boundary conditions of vanishing, it must also be defined in a setting that gives a clear interpretation to what structures are quantified. \textcopyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {This paper is one in a series of analyses of the Dutch Simonshaven murder case, each using a different modeling approach. We adopted a Bayesian network (BN)\textendash based approach which requires us to determine the relevant hypotheses and evidence in the case and their relationships (captured as a directed acyclic graph) along with explicit prior conditional probabilities. This means that both the graph structure and probabilities had to be defined using subjective judgments about the causal, and other, connections between variables and the strength and nature of the evidence. Determining if a useful BN could be quickly constructed by a small group using the previously established idioms-based approach which provides a generic method for translating legal cases into BNs, was a key aim. The model described was built by the authors during a workshop dedicated to the case at the Isaac Newton Institute, Cambridge, in September 2016. The total effort involved was approximately 26 h (i.e., an average of 6 h per author). With the basic assumptions described in the paper, the posterior probability of guilt once all the evidence is entered is 74\%. The paper describes a formal evaluation of the model, using sensitivity analysis, to determine how robust the model conclusions are to key subjective prior probabilities over a full range of what may be deemed ``reasonable'' from both defense and prosecution perspectives. The results show that the model is reasonably robust\textemdash pointing not only generally to a reasonably high posterior probability of guilt but also generally below the 95\% threshold expected in criminal law. Given the constraints on building a complex model so quickly, there are inevitably weaknesses; hence, the paper describes these and how they might be addressed, including how to take account of supplementary case information not known at the time of the workshop.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010) identified mental and substance use disorders as the 5th leading contributor of burden in 2010, measured by disability adjusted life years (DALYs). This estimate was incomplete as it excluded burden resulting from the increased risk of suicide captured elsewhere in GBD 2010's mutually exclusive list of diseases and injuries. Here, we estimate suicide DALYs attributable to mental and substance use disorders.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Relative-risk estimates of suicide due to mental and substance use disorders and the global prevalence of each disorder were used to estimate population attributable fractions. These were adjusted for global differences in the proportion of suicide due to mental and substance use disorders compared to other causes then multiplied by suicide DALYs reported in GBD 2010 to estimate attributable DALYs (with 95\% uncertainty).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Mental and substance use disorders were responsible for 22.5 million (14.8-29.8 million) of the 36.2 million (26.5-44.3 million) DALYs allocated to suicide in 2010. Depression was responsible for the largest proportion of suicide DALYs (46.1\% (28.0\%-60.8\%)) and anorexia nervosa the lowest (0.2\% (0.02\%-0.5\%)). DALYs occurred throughout the lifespan, with the largest proportion found in Eastern Europe and Asia, and males aged 20-30 years. The inclusion of attributable suicide DALYs would have increased the overall burden of mental and substance use disorders (assigned to them in GBD 2010 as a direct cause) from 7.4\% (6.2\%-8.6\%) to 8.3\% (7.1\%-9.6\%) of global DALYs, and would have changed the global ranking from 5th to 3rd leading cause of burden.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Capturing the suicide burden attributable to mental and substance use disorders allows for more accurate estimates of burden. More consideration needs to be given to interventions targeted to populations with, or at risk for, mental and substance use disorders as an effective strategy for suicide prevention.},

This framework explores the temporal structure of information flow and interarea interactions within the network of functional neuronal populations by examining topographic sharp transition processes in the scalp EEG, on the millisecond scale. We conclude, based on the OA framework, that brain functioning is best conceptualized in terms of continuity-discreteness unity which is also the characteristic property of cognition.

To test our proposal, we used, in retrospect, the results from our two early studies (. Fingelkurts, 1998; Fingelkurts et al., 2003). In both studies for the majority of experimental trails we indeed found a constellation of operationally synchronized cortical areas (indexed as DMN) that was persistent across all studied experimental conditions in all subjects. Furthermore, we found three major elements comprising this DMN: two symmetrical occipito-parieto-temporal and one frontal spatio-temporal patterns. This new data directly supports the notion that DMN has a specific functional connotation - it provides neurophysiologic basis for self-processing operations, namely first-person perspective taking and an experience of agency. ?? 2010.},

  abstract = {Using theoretical analysis of self-consciousness concept and experimental evidence on the brain default mode network (DMN) that constitutes the neural signature of self-referential processes, we hypothesized that the anterior and posterior subnets comprising the DMN should show differences in their integrity as a function of meditation training. Functional connectivity within DMN and its subnets (measured by operational synchrony) has been measured in ten novice meditators using an electroencephalogram (EEG) recording in a pre-/post-meditation intervention design. We have found that while the whole DMN was clearly suppressed, different subnets of DMN responded differently after 4 months of meditation training: The strength of EEG operational synchrony in the right and left posterior modules of the DMN decreased in resting post-meditation condition compared to a pre-meditation condition, whereas the frontal DMN module on the contrary exhibited an increase in the strength of EEG operational synchrony. These findings combined with published data on functional-anatomic heterogeneity within the DMN and on trait subjective experiences commonly found following meditation allow us to propose that the first-person perspective and the sense of agency (the witnessing observer) are presented by the frontal DMN module, while the posterior modules of the DMN are generally responsible for the experience of the continuity of 'I' as embodied and localized within bodily space. Significance of these findings is discussed.},

However, there is a lack of information concerning the effectiveness of EEG in classifying long-term (many years) outcome in chronic DOC patients. Here we tested whether EEG operational architectonics parameters (geared towards consciousness phenomenon detection rather than neurophysiological processes) could be useful for distinguishing a very long-term (6 years) clinical outcome of DOC patients whose EEGs were registered within 3 months post-injury. The obtained results suggest that EEG recorded at third month after sustaining brain damage, may contain useful information on the long-term outcome of patients in vegetative state: it could discriminate patients who remain in a persistent vegetative state from patients who reach a minimally conscious state or even recover a full consciousness in a long-term perspective (6 years) post-injury.

An important aspect in pre-clinical research is the exploration of strategies to re-establish learning ability and access to long-term memories. By using a mouse model that allows temporally and spatially restricted induction of neuronal loss, we show here that environmental enrichment reinstated learning behaviour and re-established access to long-term memories after significant brain atrophy and neuronal loss had already occurred. Environmental enrichment correlated with chromatin modifications (increased histone-tail acetylation). Moreover, increased histone acetylation by inhibitors of histone deacetylases induced sprouting of dendrites, an increased number of synapses, and reinstated learning behaviour and access to long-term memories. These data suggest that inhibition of histone deacetylases might be a suitable therapeutic avenue for neurodegenerative diseases associated with learning and memory impairment, and raises the possibility of recovery of long-term memories in patients with dementia.},

I suggest that in many adaptive systems components collectively compute their macroscopic worlds through coarse-graining. I further suggest we move from simple feedback to downward causation when components tune behaviour in response to estimates of collectively computed macroscopic properties. I introduce a weak and strong notion of downward causation and discuss the role the strong form plays in the origins of new organizational levels. I illustrate these points with examples from the study of biological and social systems and deep neural networks. This article is part of the themed issue 'Reconceptualizing the origins of life'.},

Higher memory load, associated with increased prefrontal activity, resulted in greater interference effects on behavioral performance from the distractor faces, plus increased face-related activity in the visual cortex.

At the heart of this endeavor is the notion that brain connectivity can be abstracted to a graph of nodes, representing neural elements (e.g., neurons, brain regions), linked by edges, representing some measure of structural, functional or causal interaction between nodes. Such a representation brings connectomic data into the realm of graph theory, affording a rich repertoire of mathematical tools and concepts that can be used to characterize diverse anatomical and dynamical properties of brain networks. Although this approach has tremendous potential - and has seen rapid uptake in the neuroimaging community - it also has a number of pitfalls and unresolved challenges which can, if not approached with due caution, undermine the explanatory potential of the endeavor. We review these pitfalls, the prevailing solutions to overcome them, and the challenges at the forefront of the field. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.}

  abstract = {This paper presents a model of how hippocampal place cells might be used for spatial navigation in two watermaze tasks: the standard reference memory task and a delayed matching-to-place task. In the reference memory task, the escape platform occupies a single location and rats gradually learn relatively direct paths to the goal over the course of days, in each of which they perform a fixed number of trials. In the delayed matching-to-place task, the escape platform occupies a novel location on each day, and rats gradually acquire one-trial learning, i.e., direct paths on the second trial of each day. The model uses a local, incremental, and statistically efficient connectionist algorithm called temporal difference learning in two distinct components. The first is a reinforcement-based "actor-critic" network that is a general model of classical and instrumental conditioning. In this case, it is applied to navigation, using place cells to provide information about state. By itself, the actor-critic can learn the reference memory task, but this learning is inflexible to changes to the platform location. We argue that one-trial learning in the delayed matching-to-place task demands a goal-independent representation of space. This is provided by the second component of the model: a network that uses temporal difference learning and self-motion information to acquire consistent spatial coordinates in the environment. Each component of the model is necessary at a different stage of the task; the actor-critic provides a way of transferring control to the component that performs best. The model successfully captures gradual acquisition in both tasks, and, in particular, the ultimate development of one-trial learning in the delayed matching-to-place task. Place cells report a form of stable, allocentric information that is well-suited to the various kinds of learning in the model.},

It assumes that the perception of other people is accomplished by a dynamical system involving continuous interaction between social categories, stereotypes, high-level cognitive states, and the low-level processing of facial, vocal, and bodily cues. This system permits lower-level sensory perception and higher-order social cognition to dynamically coordinate across multiple interactive levels of processing to give rise to stable person construals. A recurrent connectionist model of this system is described, which accounts for major findings on (a) partial parallel activation and dynamic competition in categorization and stereotyping, (b) top-down influences of high-level cognitive states and stereotype activations on categorization, (c) bottom-up category interactions due to shared perceptual features, and (d) contextual and cross-modal effects on categorization. The system's probabilistic and continuously evolving activation states permit multiple construals to be flexibly active in parallel. These activation states are also able to be tightly yoked to ongoing changes in external perceptual cues and to ongoing changes in high-level cognitive states. The implications of a rapidly adaptive, dynamic, and interactive person construal system are discussed.},

These actions occurred at concentrations which were greater than those used clinically in general anaesthesia (up to 0.02 mmol litre-1), therefore they reflect local rather than general anaesthetic effects which may be related to the hydrophobic properties of ketamine.

This study empirically evaluates 2 competing explanations concerning how this causal effect is brought about: (a) a traditional latent variable explanation, in which loss triggers depression which then leads to symptoms; and (b) a novel network explanation, in which bereavement directly affects particular depression symptoms which then activate other symptoms. We used data from the Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC) study and compared depressive symptomatology, assessed via the 11-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), among those who lost their partner (N ? 241) with a still-married control group (N ? 274). We modeled the effect of partner loss on depressive symptoms either as an indirect effect through a latent variable, or as a direct effect in a network constructed through a causal search algorithm. Compared to the control group, widow(er)s' scores were significantly higher for symptoms of loneliness, sadness, depressed mood, and appetite loss, and significantly lower for happiness and enjoyed life. The effect of partner loss on these symptoms was not mediated by a latent variable. The network model indicated that bereavement mainly affected loneliness, which in turn activated other depressive symptoms. The direct effects of spousal loss on particular symptoms are inconsis- tent with the predictions of latent variable models, but can be explained from a network perspective. The findings support a growing body of literature showing that specific adverse life events differentially affect depressive symptomatology, and suggest that future studies should examine interventions that directly target such},

  abstract = {This review addresses a central question in the field of complex systems: given a fluctuating (in time or space), sequentially measured set of experimental data, how should one analyze the data, assess their underlying trends, and discover the characteristics of the fluctuations that generate the experimental traces? In recent years, significant progress has been made in addressing this question for a class of stochastic processes that can be modeled by Langevin equations, including additive as well as multiplicative fluctuations or noise. Important results have emerged from the analysis of temporal data for such diverse fields as neuroscience, cardiology, finance, economy, surface science, turbulence, seismic time series and epileptic brain dynamics, to name but a few. Furthermore, it has been recognized that a similar approach can be applied to the data that depend on a length scale, such as velocity increments in fully developed turbulent flow, or height increments that characterize rough surfaces. A basic ingredient of the approach to the analysis of fluctuating data is the presence of a Markovian property, which can be detected in real systems above a certain time or length scale. This scale is referred to as the Markov-Einstein (ME) scale, and has turned out to be a useful characteristic of complex systems. We provide a review of the operational methods that have been developed for analyzing stochastic data in time and scale. We address in detail the following issues: (i) reconstruction of stochastic evolution equations from data in terms of the Langevin equations or the corresponding Fokker-Planck equations and (ii) intermittency, cascades, and multiscale correlation functions. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The process of collecting and organizing sets of observations represents a common theme throughout the history of science. However, despite the ubiquity of scientists measuring, recording and analysing the dynamics of different processes, an extensive organization of scientific time-series data and analysis methods has never been performed. Addressing this, annotated collections of over 35 000 real-world and model-generated time series, and over 9000 time-series analysis algorithms are analysed in this work.We introduce reduced representations of both time series, in terms of their properties measured by diverse scientific methods, and of time-series analysis methods, in terms of their behaviour on empirical time series, and use them to organize these interdisciplinary resources. This new approach to comparing across diverse scientific data and methods allows us to organize time-series datasets automatically according to their properties, retrieve alternatives to particular analysis methods developed in other scientific disciplines and automate the selection of useful methods for time-series classification and regression tasks. The broad scientific utility of these tools is demonstrated on datasets of electroencephalograms, self-affine time series, heartbeat intervals, speech signals and others, in each case contributing novel analysis techniques to the existing literature. Highly comparative techniques that compare across an interdisciplinary literature can thus be used to guide more focused research in time-series analysis for applications across the scientific disciplines. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

If culture is, like biology, a form of evolution, it should be possible to similarly abstract the underlying skeleton of the process and develop a minimal model of it. Meme and Variations, or MAV, is a computational model, inspired by the genetic algorithm, of how ideas evolve in a society of interacting individuals (Gabora 1995). The name is a pun on the classical music form 'theme and variations', because it is based on the premise that novel ideas are variations of old ones; they result from tweaking or combining existing ideas in new ways (Holland et al. 1981). MAV explores the impact of biological phenomena such as over-dominance and epistasis as well as cognitive and social phenomena such as the ability to learn generalizations or imitate others on the fitness and diversity of cultural transmissible actions.},

  abstract = {The pre-B\"otzinger complex (pre-B\"otC), within the mammalian respiratory brainstem, represents an ideal system for investigating the synchronization properties of complex neuronal circuits via the interaction of cell-type heterogeneity and network connectivity. In isolation, individual respiratory neurons from the pre-B\"otC may be tonically active, rhythmically bursting, or quiescent. Despite this intrinsic heterogeneity, coupled networks of pre-B\"otC neurons en bloc engage in synchronized bursting that can drive inspiratory motor neuron activation. The region's connection topology has been recently characterized and features dense clusters of cells with occasional connections between clusters. We investigate how the dynamics of individual neurons (quiescent/bursting/tonic) and the betweenness centrality of neurons' positions within the network connectivity graph interact to govern network burst synchrony, by simulating heterogeneous networks of computational model pre-B\"otC neurons. Furthermore, we compare the prevalence and synchrony of bursting across networks constructed with a variety of connection topologies, analyzing the same collection of heterogeneous neurons in small-world, scale-free, random, and regularly structured networks. We find that several measures of network burst synchronization are determined by interactions of network topology with the intrinsic dynamics of neurons at central network positions and by the strengths of synaptic connections between neurons. Surprisingly, despite the functional role of synchronized bursting within the pre-B\"otC, we find that synchronized network bursting is generally weakest when we use its specific connection topology, which leads to synchrony within clusters but poor coordination across clusters. Overall, our results highlight the relevance of interactions between topology and intrinsic dynamics in shaping the activity of networks and the concerted effects of connectivity patterns and dynamic heterogeneities.},

For each class the connexion to the original physical model and technics are outlined underlining both the similarities and the differences. Emphasis is put on the numerous novel and counterintuitive results obtained with respect to the associated social and political framework. Using these models several major real political events were successfully predicted including the victory of the French extreme right party in the 2000 first round of French presidential elections, the voting at fifty - fifty in several democratic countries (Germany, Italy, Mexico), and the victory of the no to the 2005 French referendum on the European constitution.

Sociophysics, which uses tools and concepts from the physics of disordered matter to describe some aspects of social and political behavior, answers in the affirmative. But advocating the use of models from the physical sciences to understand human behavior could be perceived as tantamount to dismissing the existence of human free will and also enabling those seeking manipulative skills . This thought-provoking book argues it is just the contrary.Indeed, future developments and evaluation will either show sociophysics to be inadequate, thus supporting the hypothesis that people can primarily be considered to be free agents, or valid, thus opening the path to a radically different vision of society and personal responsibility. This book attempts to explain why and how humans behave much like atoms, at least in some aspects of their collective lives, and then proposes how this knowledge can serve as a unique key to a dramatic leap forwards in achieving more social freedom in the real world. At heart, sociophysics and this book are about better comprehending the richness and potential of our social interaction, and so distancing ourselves from inanimate atoms.},

  abstract = {From the traditional perspective of associative learning theory, the hypothesis linking modifications of synaptic transmission to learning and memory is plausible. It is less so from an information-processing perspective, in which learning is mediated by computations that make implicit commitments to physical and mathematical principles governing the domains where domain-specific cognitive mechanisms operate. We compare the properties of associative learning and memory to the properties of long-term potentiation, concluding that the properties of the latter do not explain the fundamental properties of the former. We briefly review the neuroscience of reinforcement learning, emphasizing the representational implications of the neuroscientific findings. We then review more extensively findings that confirm the existence of complex computations in three information-processing domains: probabilistic inference, the representation of uncertainty, and the representation of space. We argue for a change in the conceptual framework within which neuroscientists approach the study of learning mechanisms in the brain.

  abstract = {We have shown previously that the AKT2 pathway is essential for cell survival and important in malignant transformation. In this study, we demonstrate elevated kinase levels of AKT2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) in 32 of 80 primary breast carcinomas. The majority of the cases with the activation are estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) positive, which prompted us to examine whether AKT2 regulates ERalpha activity. We found that constitutively activated AKT2 or AKT2 activated by epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1 promotes the transcriptional activity of ERalpha. This effect occurred in the absence or presence of estrogen. Activated AKT2 phosphorylates ERalpha in vitro and in vivo, but it does not phosphorylate a mutant ERalpha in which ser-167 was replaced by Ala. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, abolishes both the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of ERalpha induced by AKT2. However, AKT2-induced ERalpha activity was not inhibited by tamoxifen but was completely abolished by ICI 164,384, implicating that AKT2-activated ERalpha contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, we found that ERalpha binds to the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K in the absence or presence of estradiol in epithelial cells and subsequently activates PI3K/AKT2, suggesting ERalpha regulation of PI3K/AKT2 through a nontranscriptional and ligand-independent mechanism. These data indicate that regulation between the ERalpha and PI3K/AKT2 pathway (ERalpha-PI3K/AKT2-ERalpha) may play an important role in pathogenesis of human breast cancer and could contribute to ligand-independent breast cancer cell growth.},

  abstract = {Context: A key goal of landscape ecology is to understand landscape ecological processes across space and through time, with reference to the central organizing principles of nature. Towards this goal, Boltzmann (or thermodynamic) entropy has been widely used in a conceptual way to link these processes to thermodynamic laws, but it has seldom been computed because of a lack of feasible methods since its formulation in 1872. This situation will probably change because such methods have been developed very recently. Objectives: To present a timely, comprehensive review and an analysis of such methods. Methods: A systematic survey of the efforts to compute the Boltzmann entropy of a landscape was performed. The consistency of different computational methods was investigated. Results: In the review, two classes of methods were identified. The methods were developed from distinct ideas, apply to different landscape models (landscape mosaics and gradients), and result in different Boltzmann entropies. Thus, a general method for both landscape models would be desirable for consistent thermodynamic interpretations. Towards this goal, an approach was suggested to extend the method for mosaics to gradients or vice versa. Possible strategies for both extensions were theoretically analyzed and experimentally tested. Problems of each extension were revealed. Conclusions: These recently developed methods can be regarded as first steps in the computation of Boltzmann entropy for landscapes. This computation still requires much attention. Future research is recommended to improve the computation and to apply Boltzmann entropy in the thermodynamic understanding of landscape dynamics.},

  abstract = {The study of network structure has uncovered organizational principles in complex systems. However, there is also a need to understand how to control them; for example, to revert a diseased cell to a healthy state, or a mature cell to a pluripotent state. Two recent methodologies suggest that the controllability of complex multivariate systems can be predicted solely from the graph of interactions between variables, without considering variable dynamics: structural controllability and minimum dominating sets. Both methodologies utilize idealized assumptions about multivariate dynamics, yet most accurate models of real-world systems do not abide by these assumptions. Here, we study the relationship between network structure and the control of multivariate dynamics using three distinct measures of controllability in Boolean Networks. We demonstrate that structure-only methods fail to properly characterize controllability in these nonlinear systems; even in very simple networks, a large variation of possible dynamics can occur for the same structure, each with different control profiles. Our methodology is also used to characterize critical control variables in three models of biochemical regulation: the Drosophila melanogaster single-cell segment polarity network, the eukaryotic cell cycle of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the floral organ arrangement in Arabidopsis thaliana. Structure-only methods both undershoot and overshoot the number and which sets of variables actually control these models, highlighting the importance of the system dynamics in determining control. Our analysis further shows that the logic of automata transition functions, namely how canalizing they are, plays a role in the extent to which structure predicts dynamics.},

Acquisition of expertise with novel objects (greebles) led to increased activation in the right hemisphere face areas for matching of upright greebles as compared to matching inverted greebles. The same areas were also more activated in experts than in novices during passive viewing of greebles. Expertise seems to be one factor that leads to specialization in the face area.},

Overall, the view is consistent with the idea that complex neural systems, like other complex information processing systems, are highly modular. At the same time, how the modules come to interact and produce unitary goals is unknown. Here, I review the importance of self-cueing in that process of producing unitary goals from disparate functions. The role of self-cueing is demonstrably evident in the human neurologic patient and especially in patients with hemispheric disconnection. When viewed in the context of modularity, it may provide insights into how a highly parallel and distributed brain locally coordinates its activities to produce an apparent unitary output. Capturing and understanding how this is achieved will require shifting gears away from standard linear models and adopting a more dynamical systems view of brain function.

Recent studies have shown that connectivity within the default mode network is reduced with age and have demonstrated a clear relation of these changes with cognitive functioning. However, research on age-related changes in other functional networks is sparse and mainly focused on prespecified functional networks. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated age-related changes in functional connectivity during a visual oddball task in a range of functional networks. It was found that compared with young participants, elderly showed a decrease in connectivity between areas belonging to the same functional network. This was found in the default mode network and the somatomotor network. Moreover, in all identified networks, elderly showed increased connectivity between areas within these networks and areas belonging to different functional networks. Decreased connectivity within functional networks was related to poorer cognitive functioning in elderly. The results were interpreted as a decrease in the specificity of functional networks in older participants.},

We used complex network measures, derived from a brain-wide graph, to provide a comprehensive overview of age-related changes in functional connectivity. Functional connectivity in young and older participants was assessed during resting-state fMRI. The results show that aging has a large impact, not only on connectivity within functional networks but also on connectivity between the different functional networks in the brain. Brain networks in the elderly showed decreased modularity (less distinct functional networks) and decreased local efficiency. Connectivity decreased with age within networks supporting higher level cognitive functions, that is, within the default mode, cingulo-opercular and fronto-parietal control networks. Conversely, no changes in connectivity within the somatomotor and visual networks, networks implicated in primary information processing, were observed. Connectivity between these networks even increased with age. A brain-wide analysis approach of functional connectivity in the aging brain thus seems fundamental in understanding how age affects integration of information.},

Despite an increasingly large number of invertebrate and rodent studies showing profound electrophysiological and behavioral effects induced by optogenetics [1, 2], only two primate studies have reported modulation of local single-cell activity but with no behavioral effects [3, 4]. Here, we show that optogenetic stimulation of cortical neurons within rhesus monkey arcuate sulcus, during the execution of a visually guided saccade task, evoked significant and reproducible changes in saccade latencies as a function of target position. Moreover, using concurrent optogenetic stimulation and opto-fMRI [5, 6]), we observed optogenetically induced changes in fMRI activity in specific functional cortical networks throughout the monkey brain. This is critical information for the advancement of optogenetic primate research models and for initiating the development of optogenetically based cell-specific therapies with which to treat neurological diseases in humans. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {To understand the functional role of specific neurons in micro- and macro-brain circuitry, health, and disease, it is critical to control their activity precisely. This ambitious goal was first achieved by optogenetics, allowing researchers to increase or decrease neural activity artificially with high temporal and spatial precision. In contrast to the revolution optogenetics engendered in invertebrate and rodent research, only a few studies have reported optogenetic-induced neuronal and behavioral effects in primates. Such studies are nonetheless critical before optogenetics can be applied in a clinical setting. Here, we review the state-of-the-art tools for performing optogenetics in mammals, emphasizing recent neuronal and behavioral results obtained in nonhuman primates. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The goal of this tutorial is to promote interest in the study of random Boolean networks (RBNs). These can be very interesting models, since one does not have to assume any functionality or particular connectivity of the networks to study their generic properties. Like this, RBNs have been used for exploring the configurations where life could emerge. The fact that RBNs are a generalization of cellular automata makes their research a very important topic. The tutorial, intended for a broad audience, presents the state of the art in RBNs, spanning over several lines of research carried out by different groups. We focus on research done within artificial life, as we cannot exhaust the abundant research done over the decades related to RBNs.},

Brain circuitries important for social, communicative, and integrational purposes have been suggested to be dysfunctional in autism. There could be at least two different pathways to autism, one connected with primary temporofrontal dysfunction (and late prenatal-early postnatal origins) and another linked to primary brain-stem dysfunction (and early prenatal origins). Further study of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychological processes in autism will help elucidate not only the pathological mechanisms involved in the specific syndromes but also the underpinnings of normal brain development.},

RABV has been recognized for years for its properties as a synapse-specific trans-neuronal tracer. A novel genetically modified variant now enables the investigation of specific monosynaptic connections. This technology, in combination with other genetic, physiological, optical, and computational tools, has enormous potential for the visualization of neuronal circuits, and for monitoring and manipulating their activity.

  abstract = {The likelihood of initiating addictive behaviors is higher during adolescence than during any other developmental period. The differential developmental trajectories of brain regions involved in motivation and control processes may lead to adolescents' increased risk taking in general, which may be exacerbated by the neural consequences of drug use. Neuroimaging studies suggest that increased risk-taking behavior in adolescence is related to an imbalance between prefrontal cortical regions, associated with executive functions, and subcortical brain regions related to affect and motivation. Dual-process models of addictive behaviors are similarly concerned with difficulties in controlling abnormally strong motivational processes. We acknowledge concerns raised about dual-process models, but argue that they can be addressed by carefully considering levels of description: motivational processes and top-down biasing can be understood as intertwined, co-developing components of more versus less reflective states of processing. We illustrate this with a model that further emphasizes temporal dynamics. Finally, behavioral interventions for addiction are discussed. Insights in the development of control and motivation may help to better understand - and more efficiently intervene in - vulnerabilities involving control and motivation.},

Coupling between the spins is introduced through the assumption that the transition probabilities for any one spin depend on the values of the neighboring spins. This dependence is determined, in part, by the detailed balancing condition obeyed by the equilibrium state of the model. The Markoff process which describes the spin functions is analyzed in detail for the case of a closed N-member chain. The expectation values of the individual spins and of the products of pairs of spins, each of the pair evaluated at a different time, are found explicitly. The influence of a uniform, time-varying magnetic field upon the model is discussed, and the frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility is found in the weak-field limit. Some fluctuation-dissipation theorems are derived which relate the susceptibility to the Fourier transform of the time-dependent correlation function of the magnetization at equilibrium.},

Faster phonetic learners appeared to have more white matter in parietal regions, especially in the left hemisphere. The pattern of results was similar for the rapidly changing but not for the steady-state nonlinguistic stimuli, suggesting that morphological correlates of phonetic learning are related to the ability to process rapid temporal variation. Greater asymmetry in the amount of white matter in faster learners may be related to greater myelination allowing more efficient neural processing, which is critical for the ability to process certain speech sounds.},

Hippocampal lesions in rodents impair spatial memory on radial arm maze tasks. It is unknown whether amnesic patients with hippocampal damage would exhibit similar impairments on a virtual version of a radial arm maze. To evaluate the importance of the hippocampus in spatial learning and memory, we tested amnesic participants with hippocampal damage in a virtual radial arm maze environment. The virtual radial arm maze required participants to learn and remember 4 rewarded arms of 8 total arms. Spatial learning and memory were assessed using the participants' ability to use salient distal cues in the virtual room to remember the 4 rewarded arms. Amnesic participants' latencies were longer and distance traveled was greater to the rewarded arms compared with nonamnesic participants. Amnesic participants made more errors than nonamnesic participants by either entering nonrewarded arms or by revisiting previously entered arms. These data are analogous to previous animal research. Overall, the human hippocampus is necessary for spatial memory and navigation in a virtual radial arm maze task.},

Modelers, decision makers, scientists, and other water resources stakeholders all utilize some notion of cause-and-effect to understand processes, make decisions, and infer how systems react to change. However, there are different perspectives on the meaning of causality in complex systems and, further, different frameworks and methodologies with which to detect causal interactions. We propose here that information theory (IT) provides a compelling framework for the detection of causality and discuss approaches for several levels of analyses that capture interactions that range from pairwise to multivariate in nature. We illustrate these types of analyses with an example based on weather station time series variables, in which variables may interact pairwise or jointly and on short to long time scales. In general, many unsolved or even unanticipated questions in the hydrologic sciences could benefit from this perspective.}

However, some portion of the variability arises from fluctuations in excitability due to factors that are not purely sensory, such as arousal, attention and adaptation. To isolate these fluctuations, we developed a model in which spikes are generated by a Poisson process whose rate is the product of a drive that is sensory in origin and a gain summarizing stimulus-independent modulatory influences on excitability. This model provides an accurate account of response distributions of visual neurons in macaque lateral geniculate nucleus and cortical areas V1, V2 and MT, revealing that variability originates in large part from excitability fluctuations that are correlated over time and between neurons, and that increase in strength along the visual pathway. The model provides a parsimonious explanation for observed systematic dependencies of response variability and covariability on firing rate.},

We solve a long-standing open question and find computationally that, for large system sizes \$N\$, adaptive information processing drives the networks to a critical connectivity \$K\_\{c\}=2\$. For finite size networks, the connectivity approaches the critical value with a power-law of the system size \$N\$. We show that network learning and generalization are optimized near criticality, given task complexity and the amount of information provided threshold values. Both random and evolved networks exhibit maximal topological diversity near \$K\_\{c\}\$. We hypothesize that this supports efficient exploration and robustness of solutions. Also reflected in our observation is that the variance of the values is maximal in critical network populations. Finally, we discuss implications of our results for determining the optimal topology of adaptive dynamical networks that solve computational tasks.},

Recent findings from social and biological networks pinpoint the significant role of weak connections in network coherence and mediation of information from segregated parts of the network. In the current study, inspired by such findings and proposed architectures pertaining to social networks, we examine the structure of weak connections in the macaque cortico-cortical network by employing a tract-tracing dataset. We demonstrate that the cortico-cortical connections as a whole, as well as connections between segregated communities of brain areas, comply with the architecture suggested by the so-called strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis. However, we find that the wiring of these connections is not optimal with respect to the aforementioned architecture. This configuration is not attributable to a trade-off with factors known to constrain brain wiring, i.e., wiring cost and efficiency. Lastly, weak connections, but not strong ones, appear important for network cohesion. Our findings relate a topological property to the strength of cortico-cortical connections, highlight the prominent role of weak connections in the cortico-cortical structural network and pinpoint their potential functional significance. These findings suggest that certain neuroimaging studies, despite methodological challenges, should explicitly take them into account and not treat them as negligible.},

Previous studies have demonstrated that small changes in the lateralization of alpha-band activity are predictive of behavioral performance but have not directly investigated how flexibly alpha lateralization is linked to top-down attentional goals. To address this question, we presented participants with cues providing varying degrees of spatial certainty about the location at which a target would appear. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data demonstrated that manipulating spatial certainty led to graded changes in the extent to which alpha oscillations were lateralized over the occipitoparietal cortex during the cue-target interval. We found that individual differences in alpha desynchronization contralateral to attention predicted reaction times, event-related potential measures of perceptual processing of targets, and beta-band (15-25 Hz) activity typically associated with response preparation. These results support the hypothesis that anticipatory alpha modulation is a plausible neural mechanism underlying the allocation of visuospatial attention and is under flexible top-down control.},

The method estimates the FS effects in many-body electronic structure calculations of extended systems by a modified density functional theory (DFT) calculation, without having to repeat expensive many-body simulations. We construct a unified FS DFT exchange-correlation functional for spin unpolarized and fully spin polarized systems, under the local density approximation. The results are then interpolated to arbitrary spin polarizations. Generalization to other functional forms in DFT are discussed. The application of this FS correction method to several typical magnetic systems with varying supercell sizes demonstrates that it consistently removes most of the FS errors, leading to rapid convergence of the many-body results to the infinite size limit.}

Hierarchical, two-level structures of interpersonal interactions and spatial localization of individuals are taken into account. The effect of the mass media, modeled as an external stimulation acting on the social network, on the process of opinion formation is investigated. It was found that in the time evolution of opinions of individuals critical phenomena occur. The first one is observed in the critical temperature of the system TC and is connected with the situation in the community, which may be described by such quantifiers as the economic status of people, unemployment or crime wave. Another critical phenomenon is connected with the influence of mass media on the population. As results from our computations, under certain circumstances the mass media can provoke critical rebuilding of opinions in the population. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Testable definitions of causality and feedback are proposed and illustrated by use of simple two-variable models. The important problem of apparent instantaneous causality is discussed and it is suggested that the problem often arises due to slowness in recording information or because a sufficiently wide class of possible causal variables has not been used. It can be shown that the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation. Measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed. A generalisation of this result with the partial cross spectrum is suggested. CR - Copyright; 1969 The Econometric Society},

We also establish the conditions for extinction and persistence for the stochastic SIS epidemic model and compare these with the corresponding conditions for the deterministic SIS epidemic model. We first prove these results for a two-state Markov chain and then generalise them to a finite state space Markov chain. Computer simulations based on the explicit solution and the Euler-Maruyama scheme are performed to illustrate our theory.

In contrast to studies with other serotypes (AAV2, AAV4 and AAV5) in rodents, we report that a naturally occurring capsid (AAV9) and rationally engineered capsid (AAV2.5) are able to achieve broad transduction throughout the brain and spinal cord parenchyma following a single injection into the CSF (via cisterna magna or lumbar cistern) in non-human primates (NHP). Using either vector at a dose of approximately 2 x 10(12) vector genome (vg) per 3-6 kg animal, approximately 2\% of the entire brain and spinal cord was transduced, covering all regions of the central nervous system (CNS). AAV9 in particular displayed efficient transduction of spinal cord motor neurons. The peripheral organ biodistribution was highly reduced compared with intravascular delivery, and the presence of circulating anti-AAV-neutralizing antibodies up to a 1:128 titer had no inhibitory effect on CNS gene transfer. Intra-CSF delivery effectively translates from rodents to NHPs, which provides encouragement for the use of this approach in humans to treat motor neuron and lysosomal storage diseases.},

  abstract = {Adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes differ broadly in transduction efficacies and tissue tropisms and thus hold enormous potential as vectors for human gene therapy. In reality, however, their use in patients is restricted by prevalent anti-AAV immunity or by their inadequate performance in specific targets, exemplified by the AAV type 2 (AAV-2) prototype in the liver. Here, we attempted to merge desirable qualities of multiple natural AAV isolates by an adapted DNA family shuffling technology to create a complex library of hybrid capsids from eight different wild-type viruses. Selection on primary or transformed human hepatocytes yielded pools of hybrids from five of the starting serotypes: 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9. More stringent selection with pooled human antisera (intravenous immunoglobulin [IVIG]) then led to the selection of a single type 2/type 8/type 9 chimera, AAV-DJ, distinguished from its closest natural relative (AAV-2) by 60 capsid amino acids. Recombinant AAV-DJ vectors outperformed eight standard AAV serotypes in culture and greatly surpassed AAV-2 in livers of na\"ive and IVIG-immunized mice. A heparin binding domain in AAV-DJ was found to limit biodistribution to the liver (and a few other tissues) and to affect vector dose response and antibody neutralization. Moreover, we report the first successful in vivo biopanning of AAV capsids by using a new AAV-DJ-derived viral peptide display library. Two peptides enriched after serial passaging in mouse lungs mediated the retargeting of AAV-DJ vectors to distinct alveolar cells. Our study validates DNA family shuffling and viral peptide display as two powerful and compatible approaches to the molecular evolution of novel AAV vectors for human gene therapy applications.},

The role of decision-support for this process remains to be defined. Methods: A randomized controlled trial of a computer-based hormone therapy (HT) decision-aid versus a control intervention consisting of a printed pamphlet among 177 post-menopausal women receiving care in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Results: Participants found the computer-based decision-aid easy to use and retained risk information incorporated from emerging scientific data. There was no difference between groups with respect to the primary outcomes of knowledge, satisfaction with decision, decisional conflict or HT use. A trend was reported towards decreased decisional conflict in the evidence in decision-making (p = 0.07) and factors of uncertainty (p = 0.06) domains among the subset of participants who were on HT at baseline and used the computer-based decision-aid. Conclusion: The computer-based decision-aid was able to effectively incorporate emerging scientific information but was no more effective than a printed pamphlet control with regard to improving decision-process outcomes. Practice implications: The incremental benefit of a complex versus simpler decision-aid for post-menopausal women remains to be established prior to widespread dissemination of interactive computer-based HT decision-aids.

  abstract = {Cognitive function is driven by dynamic interactions between large-scale neural circuits or networks, enabling behaviour. However, fundamental principles constraining these dynamic network processes have remained elusive. Here we use tools from control and network theories to offer a mechanistic explanation for how the brain moves between cognitive states drawn from the network organization of white matter microstructure. Our results suggest that densely connected areas, particularly in the default mode system, facilitate the movement of the brain to many easily reachable states. Weakly connected areas, particularly in cognitive control systems, facilitate the movement of the brain to difficult-to-reach states. Areas located on the boundary between network communities, particularly in attentional control systems, facilitate the integration or segregation of diverse cognitive systems. Our results suggest that structural network differences between cognitive circuits dictate their distinct roles in controlling trajectories of brain network function.},

Particularly, the method extracts features using the Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution combined with the McAulay-Quatieri sinusoidal model and identifies abnormal neural discharges. We propose a new feature based on the length of the track that, combined with energy and frequency features, allows to isolate a continuous energy trace from another oscillations when an epileptic seizure is beginning. We evaluate our approach using data consisting of 16 different seizures from 6 epileptic patients. The results show that our extraction method is a suitable approach for automatic seizure detection, and opens the possibility of formulating new criteria to detect and analyze abnormal EEGs.},

In that paper, Shannon defined what the once fuzzy concept of "information" meant for communication engineers and proposed a precise way to quantify it-in his theory, the fundamental unit of information is the bit. He also showed how data could be "compressed" before transmission and how virtually error-free communication could be achieved. The concepts Shannon developed in his paper are at the heart of today's digital information technology. CDs, DVDs, cell phones, fax machines, modems, computer networks, hard drives, memory chips, encryption schemes, MP3 music, optical communication, high-definition television-all these things embody many of Shannon's ideas and others inspired by him.},

It shows that within each stratum, there is a progression of opportunity that contributes to criminal actors' motivations to proceed with their criminal careers. Each progressing stratum has a significant barrier to entry that, once overcome, signals a state where risk, income potential, and stability change significantly. Nonetheless, illicit entrepreneurs continue to attempt to progress as long as they believe that opportunity is consistent, and the risk involved is acceptable. To that end, many criminal entrepreneurs who are successful in prolonging their criminal careers seek to occupy the ``sweet spot,'' a position characterized by four outcomes: minimizing risk to reward, achieving low visibility, developing a comparative advantage in their illicit industry that, in turn, gives them independence, and economic stability.},

Although experimental analysis of the embryo and larva is extensive and the morphology has been well documented, descriptions of adult zebrafish anatomy and studies of development of the adult structures and organs, together with techniques for working with adults are lacking. The organs of the larva undergo significant changes in their overall structure, morphology, and anatomical location during the larval to adult transition. Externally, the transparent larva develops its characteristic adult striped pigment pattern and paired pelvic fins, while internally, the organs undergo massive growth and remodeling. In addition, the bipotential gonad primordium develops into either testis or ovary. This protocol identifies many of the organs of the adult and demonstrates methods for dissection of the brain, gonads, gastrointestinal system, heart, and kidney of the adult zebrafish. The dissected organs can be used for in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, histology, RNA extraction, protein analysis, and other molecular techniques. This protocol will assist in the broadening of studies in the zebrafish to include the remodeling of larval organs, the morphogenesis of organs specific to the adult and other investigations of the adult organ systems.},

Fixed effects estimates suggest that marriage actually decreases close social ties to religious congregations, whereas rearing children within marital unions increases them. Thus, it is children, not marriage per se, that actually integrates married couples into religious communities. These contrasting effects tend to be the strongest among young adults, but they weaken with age as well as marital duration.},

Then I will look in more detail at some of the 'engineering details' of its implementation (or lack thereof) in each of these settings. In other words, the question posed is: What is actually happening? For example, we previously found that humans overwhelmingly seek, create or imagine context in order to provide meaning when presented with abstract, apparently incomplete, contradictory or otherwise untenable decision-making situations. Humans are intolerant of contradiction and will greatly simplify to avoid it. They can partially correlate but do not average. Human learning is not Boolean. These and other human reasoning properties will then be taken to critique how well artificial intelligence methods and quantum mechanical modelling might compete with them in decision-making tasks within psychology and economics.},

Thus, correctly modeling and quantifying human mobility is critical for studying large-scale spatial transmission of infectious diseases and improving epidemic control. In this study, a large-scale agent-based transport simulation (MATSim) is linked with a generic epidemic spread model to simulate the spread of communicable diseases in an urban environment. The use of an agent-based model allows reproduction of the real-world behavior of individuals' daily path in an urban setting and allows the capture of interactions among them, in the form of a spatial-temporal social network. This model is used to study seasonal influenza outbreaks in the metropolitan area of Zurich, Switzerland. The observations of the agent-based models are compared with results from classical SIR models. The model presented is a prototype that can be used to analyze multiple scenarios in the case of a disease spread at an urban scale, considering variations of different model parameters settings. The results of this simulation can help to improve comprehension of the disease spread dynamics and to take better steps towards the prevention and control of an epidemic.},

Here, we systematically studied variability in posterior alpha peak frequency both between and within subjects. We recorded brain activity using MEG in 51 healthy human subjects under three experimental conditions - rest, passive visual stimulation and an N-back working memory paradigm, using source reconstruction methods to separate alpha activity from parietal and occipital sources. We asked how alpha peak frequency differed within subjects across cognitive conditions and regions of interest, and looked at the distribution of alpha peak frequency between subjects. In both regions we observed an increase of alpha peak frequency from resting state and passive visual stimulation conditions to the N-back paradigm, with a significantly higher alpha peak frequency in the 2-back compared to the 0-back condition. There was a trend for a greater increase in alpha peak frequency during the N-back task in the occipital vs. parietal cortex. The average alpha peak frequency across all subjects, conditions, and regions of interest was 10.3Hz with a within-subject SD of 0.9Hz and a between-subject SD of 2.8Hz. We also measured beta peak frequencies, and except in the parietal cortex during rest, found no indication of a strictly harmonic relationship with alpha peak frequencies. We conclude that alpha peak frequency in posterior regions increases with increasing cognitive demands, and that the alpha rhythm operates across a wider frequency range than the 8-12Hz band many studies tend to include in their analysis. Thus, using a fixed and limited alpha frequency band might bias results against certain subjects and conditions.},

Recently we found that archaerhodopsin-3 from Halorubrum sodomense (Arch), a light-driven outward proton pump, when genetically expressed in neurons, enables them to be powerfully, transiently, and repeatedly silenced in response to pulses of light. Because of the impressive characteristics of Arch, we explored the optogenetic utility of opsins with high sequence homology to Arch, from archaea of the Halorubrum genus. We found that the archaerhodopsin from Halorubrum strain TP009, which we named ArchT, could mediate photocurrents of similar maximum amplitude to those of Arch ({$\sim$}900\,pA in vitro), but with a {$>$}3-fold improvement in light sensitivity over Arch, most notably in the optogenetic range of 1-10 mW/mm(2), equating to {$>$}2\texttimes{} increase in brain tissue volume addressed by a typical single optical fiber. Upon expression in mouse or rhesus macaque cortical neurons, ArchT expressed well on neuronal membranes, including excellent trafficking for long distances down neuronal axons. The high light sensitivity prompted us to explore ArchT use in the cortex of the rhesus macaque. Optical perturbation of ArchT-expressing neurons in the brain of an awake rhesus macaque resulted in a rapid and complete ({$\sim$}100\%) silencing of most recorded cells, with suppressed cells achieving a median firing rate of 0 spikes/s upon illumination. A small population of neurons showed increased firing rates at long latencies following the onset of light stimulation, suggesting the existence of a mechanism of network-level neural activity balancing. The powerful net suppression of activity suggests that ArchT silencing technology might be of great use not only in the causal analysis of neural circuits, but may have therapeutic applications.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the hope that the thermodynamical framework might be extended to strongly interacting statistical systems - complex systems in particular - a number of generalized entropies has been proposed in the past. So far the understanding of their fundamental origin has remained unclear. Here we address this question from first principles. We start by observing that many statistical systems fulfill a set of three general conditions (Shannon-Khinchin axioms, K1-K3). A fourth condition (separability) holds for non-interacting, uncorrelated or Markovian systems only (Shannon-Khinchin axiom, K4). If all four axioms hold the Shannon theorem provides a unique entropy, S = {$\Sigma$}iW pi ln pi, i.e. Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. Here we ask about the consequences of violating the 4th axiom while assuming the first three to hold. By a simple scaling argument we prove that under these conditions each statistical system is characterized by a unique pair of scaling exponents (c, d) in the large size limit. These exponents define equivalence classes for all interacting and non-interacting systems and parametrize a unique entropy, Sc,d {$\propto$} {$\Sigma$}iW {$\Gamma$}(d+1, 1-c ln pi), where {$\Gamma$}(a, b) is the incomplete Gamma function. It covers all systems respecting K1-K3. A series of known entropies can be classified in terms of these equivalence classes. Corresponding distribution functions are special forms of Lambert-W exponentials containing - as special cases - Boltzmann, stretched exponential and Tsallis distributions (power laws) - all widely abundant in Nature. In the derivation we assume S = {$\Sigma$}i g(pi), with g some function, however more general entropic forms can be classified along the same lines. This is to our knowledge the first ab initio justification for generalized entropies. We discuss a physical example displaying two sets of scaling exponents depending on the external parameters.

The framework of superstatistics allows one to formulate a maximum entropy principle with these generalized entropies, making them useful for understanding distribution functions of non-Markovian or nonergodic complex systems. For such systems where the composability axiomis violated there exist only two ways to implement the maximum entropy principle, one using escort probabilities, the other not. The two ways are connected through a duality. Here we show that this duality fixes a unique escort probability, which allows us to derive a complete theory of the generalized logarithms that naturally arise from the violation of this axiom. We then show how the functional forms of these generalized logarithms are related to the asymptotic scaling behavior of the entropy.},

Accelerating, path-dependent and aging random walks offer an intuitive picture for non-ergodic and non-Markovian systems. It was shown that the entropy of non-ergodic systems can still be derived from three of the Shannon-Khinchin axioms and by violating the fourth, the so-called composition axiom. The corresponding entropy is of the form Sc,d\textasciitilde{$\sigma$}i{$\gamma$}(1+d; 1-c ln pi) and depends on two system-specific scaling exponents, c and d. This entropy contains many recently proposed entropy functionals as special cases, including Shannon and Tsallis entropy. It was shown that this entropy is relevant for a special class of non-Markovian random walks. In this work, we generalize these walks to a much wider class of stochastic systems that can be characterized as "aging" walks. These are systems whose transition rates between states are path- and time-dependent. We show that for particular aging walks, Sc;d is again the correct extensive entropy. Before the central part of the paper, we review the concept of (c; d)-entropy in a self-contained way. \textcopyright{} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Relations between EF, age and everyday difficulties (rated by parents and teachers) were also examined. Both clinical groups showed significant EF impairments compared with TD peers. The ADHD group showed greater inhibitory problems on a Go-no-Go task, while the ASD group was significantly worse on response selection/monitoring in a cognitive estimates task. Age-related improvements were clearer in ASD and TD than in ADHD. At older (but not younger) ages, the ASD group outperformed the ADHD group, performing as well as the TD group on many EF measures. EF scores were related to specific aspects of communicative and social adaptation, and negatively correlated with hyperactivity in ASD and TD.

In particular, we obtain closed-form solutions for some cases, while interpreting key epidemic variables, such as the reproductive ratio R0 of a SIS model, in a statistical mechanical setting. On the other hand, we consider configuration and free entropy, as well as the Fisher information, in the epidemiological context. This allowed us to identify criticality and distinct phases of epidemic processes.

New features of the implantable pulse generator (IPG) allow fractionation of the electric current into variable proportions between different contacts of the multi-polar lead. Another design consists in leads that allow selective current steering from directionally placed electrode contacts that would deliver the stimulation in a specific direction or even create a directional shaped electric field that would conform to the anatomy of the brain target aimed at, avoiding adjacent structures, and thus avoiding side effects.Closed loop adaptive stimulation technologies are being developed, allowing a tracking of the pathological local field potential of the brain target, and delivering automatically the stimulation to suppress the pathological activity as soon as it is detected and for as long as needed. This feature may contribute to a DBS therapy "on demand", instead of continuously.Finally, advances in imaging technology are providing "new" brain targets, and increasingly allowing DBS to be performed accurately while avoiding the risks of microelectrode recording. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We find that the diversity of flow patterns can be mapped into a single universal function, characterizing the interplay between the system's topology and its dynamics, ultimately allowing us to identify the network's main arteries of information flow. Counter-intuitively, our formalism predicts a family of frequently encountered dynamics where the flow of information avoids the hubs, favoring the network's peripheral pathways, a striking disparity between structure and dynamics.},

It explains how such a position leads to the problem of computational intractability. It proposes that effective control may be possible for a more tractable, even "lazy," control system that does not maintain any internal models of the world, assuming that such "lazy" control systems co-evolve with the bodies and environments of organisms. This co-evolution ensures a certain degree of fit between the control system of an organism and its life world. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

In addition, we extend both models to the time-varying case in which the true model changes over time, under the assumption that change is a smooth function of time. Time-varying models offer a rich description of temporally evolving systems as they provide information about organizational processes, information diffusion, vulnerabilities and the potential impact of interventions. Next to introducing the theory of the implemented methods and explaining the software package, we provide performance benchmarks and applications to two medical datasets.},

However, little is known about the network of anatomical connections in the human brain. Here, we investigated large-scale anatomical connection patterns of the human cerebral cortex using cortical thickness measurements from magnetic resonance images. Two areas were considered anatomically connected if they showed statistically significant correlations in cortical thickness and we constructed the network of such connections using 124 brains from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping database. Significant short- and long-range connections were found in both intra- and interhemispheric regions, many of which were consistent with known neuroanatomical pathways measured by human diffusion imaging. More importantly, we showed that the human brain anatomical network had robust small-world properties with cohesive neighborhoods and short mean distances between regions that were insensitive to the selection of correlation thresholds. Additionally, we also found that this network and the probability of finding a connection between 2 regions for a given anatomical distance had both exponentially truncated power-law distributions. Our results demonstrated the basic organizational principles for the anatomical network in the human brain compatible with previous functional networks studies, which provides important implications of how functional brain states originate from their structural underpinnings. To our knowledge, this study provides the first report of small-world properties and degree distribution of anatomical networks in the human brain using cortical thickness measurements.},

On the one hand, the irregularity might arise from stochastic forces. If so, the irregular interspike interval reflects a random process and implies that an instantaneous estimate of the spike rate can be obtained by averaging the pooled responses of many individual neurons. In keeping with this theory, one would expect that the precise timing of individual spikes conveys little information. Alternatively, the irregular ISI may result from precise coincidences of presynaptic events. In this scenario, it is postulated that the timing of spikes, their intervals and patterns can convey information. According to this view, the irregularity of the ISI reflects a rich bandwidth for information transfer. In this handout, we take the former point of view, that the irregular spike interval reflects a random process. We assume that the generation of each spike depends only on an underlying continuous/analog driving signal, r(t),},

Cell type-specific enhancer selection involves the binding of lineage-determining transcription factors that prime enhancers. Signal-dependent transcription factors bind to primed enhancers, which enables these broadly expressed factors to regulate gene expression in a cell type-specific manner. The expression of genes that specify cell type identity and function is associated with densely spaced clusters of active enhancers known as super-enhancers.

Episodic memory formation requires the rapid encoding of associations between different aspects of an event which, according to these models, depends on the hippocampus and on consciousness. However, recent evidence indicates that the hippocampus mediates rapid associative learning with and without consciousness in humans and animals, for long-term and short-term retention. Consciousness seems to be a poor criterion for differentiating between declarative (or explicit) and non declarative (or implicit) types of memory. A new model is therefore required in which memory systems are distinguished based on the processing operations involved rather than by consciousness.},

  abstract = {A major achievement in the study of complex networks is the realization that diverse systems, from sub-cellular biology to social networks, exhibit universal topological characteristics. Yet, such universality does not naturally translate to the dynamics of these systems, as dynamic behaviour cannot be uniquely predicted from topology alone. Rather, it depends on the interplay of the network's topology with the dynamic mechanisms of interaction between the nodes. Hence, systems with similar structure may exhibit profoundly different dynamic behaviour. We therefore seek a general theoretical framework to help us systematically translate topological elements into their predicted dynamic outcome. Here, we offer such a translation in the context of signal propagation, linking the topology of a network to the observed spatiotemporal spread of perturbative signals across it, thus capturing the network's role in propagating local information. For a range of nonlinear dynamic models, we predict that the propagation rules condense into three highly distinctive dynamic regimes, characterized by the interplay between network paths, degree distribution and the interaction dynamics. As a result, classifying a system's intrinsic interaction mechanisms into the relevant dynamic regime allows us to systematically translate topology into dynamic patterns of information propagation.}

  abstract = {Cities are complex systems, comprising of many interacting parts. How we simulate and understand causality in urban systems is continually evolving. Over the last decade the agent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm has provided a new lens for understanding the effects of interactions of individuals and how through such interactions macro structures emerge, both in the social and physical environment of cities. However, such a paradigm has been hindered due to computational power and a lack of large fine scale datasets. Within the last few years we have witnessed a massive increase in computational processing power and storage, combined with the onset of Big Data. Today geographers find themselves in a data rich era. We now have access to a variety of data sources (e.g., social media, mobile phone data, etc.) that tells us how, and when, individuals are using urban spaces. These data raise several questions: can we effectively use them to understand and model cities as complex entities? How well have ABM approaches lent themselves to simulating the dynamics of urban processes? What has been, or will be, the influence of Big Data on increasing our ability to understand and simulate cities? What is the appropriate level of spatial analysis and time frame to model urban phenomena? Within this paper we discuss these questions using several examples of ABM applied to urban geography to begin a dialogue about the utility of ABM for urban modeling. The arguments that the paper raises are applicable across the wider research environment where researchers are considering using this approach.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In this review I present an effort to mutually translate the work conducted by scholars from both of these academic fronts hoping to continue to unify what has become a diverging body of literature. I argue that social and natural scientists fail to see eye to eye because they have diverging academic goals. Social scientists focus on explaining how context specific social and economic mechanisms drive the structure of networks and on how networks shape social and economic outcomes. By contrast, natural scientists focus primarily on modeling network characteristics that are independent of context, since their focus is to identify universal characteristics of systems instead of context specific mechanisms. In the following pages I discuss the differences between both of these literatures by summarizing the parallel theories advanced to explain link formation and the applications used by scholars in each field to justify their approach to network science. I conclude by providing an outlook on how these literatures can be further unified.},

  abstract = {Magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures the magnetic fields outside the head created by electrical neuronal activity. The aim of many studies is to subsequently determine the spatiotemporal characteristics of these neuronal sources on the basis of the extracranial recordings, which means that an inverse problem needs to be solved. The MEG inverse problem is theoretically insoluble; just as inferring a three-dimensional scene from a two-dimensional image is insoluble. However, we are able to interpret cinematic images because we make certain assumptions about the world (the size of people, the way shadows fall) that allow us to achieve a percept. In MEG we are searching for a similar set of assumptions on which to base algorithms to interpret the MEG data. Recent work has shown that a class of algorithms used to solve the MEG inverse problem produce functionally plausible and verifiable results. These algorithms make the assumption that no two distinct cortical areas are perfectly linearly correlated in their activation time series and it has been shown empirically that this assumption is often justified. First, the spatial concurrence of beamformer images of induced neuronal activity and the BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response was demonstrated in a biological motion and a letter fluency task (Singh et al., 2002) and more recently in a working memory task (Coppola et al., 2004). Second, beamformer analysis has been applied successfully in various experimental paradigms, ranging from experiments involving primary visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices as well as the use of more cognitively demanding paradigms (e.g., Fawcett et al., 2004; Furlong et al., 2004; Gaetz and Cheyne, 2003; Hashimoto et al., 2001; Herdman et al., 2003; Hobson et al., 2005; Kamada et al., 1998; Ploner et al., 2002; Taniguchi et al., 2000; Ukai et al., 2002; also see Hillebrand et al., 2005, for review). One of the main advantages of beamformer analysis is that induced changes in cortical oscillatory power that do not result in a strong average-evoked response can be identified and localized. In particular, by using an active and control state, stimulus induced increases and decreases in cortical rhythms, known as event-related synchronization (ERS) and event-related desynchronization (ERD), respectively (Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999), can be quantified. Such changes in ongoing activity have been shown to play an important role in cognitive function (Arieli et al., 1996; Basar et al., 2001; Karakas et al., 2000; Kenet et al., 2003; Makeig et al., 2002; Ringach, 2003), and consequently form the basis of many theories of consciousness (Engel et al., 2001; Freeman, 2000; Llin\'as et al., 1998; Singer, 1998; Tononi and Edelman, 1998). Another advantage of beamformer analysis is that there is relatively little user interaction. The only parameters that a user needs to select are the size of the reconstruction grid, the time-frequency window over which to run the analysis, and optionally the amount of noise regularization. Importantly, there is no need to define the number of active sources a priori, since the beamformer output is computed for each voxel in the source-space independently and sequentially. The user friendliness of the technique makes it suitable for use in a clinical setting. This chapter is divided in two main sections. In the first section we describe the basic algorithmic steps that compose the beamformer and the characteristics of the reconstructed image of neuronal activity. We restrict almost all of our discussion to the measurement of induced and not evoked electrical activity. The beamformer approach has been used successfully in many experimental settings, hinting at the validity of the assumptions behind the technique. In the second section of this chapter we develop a case for why the beamformer assumption set, although simplistic, may indeed be quite plausible. \textcopyright{} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We propose that the networks of emerging firms evolve in order to adapt to the firm's changing resource needs and resource challenges. As firms emerge, their networks consist primarily of socially embedded ties drawn from dense, cohesive sets of connections. We label these networks identity based. As firms move into the early growth stage, their networks evolve toward more ties based on a calculation of economic costs and benefits. This shift from identity-based to more calculative networks is manifested in the evolution of the firm networks: (1) from primarily socially embedded ties to a balance of embedded and arm's-length relations; (2) from networks that emphasize cohesion to those that exploit structural holes; and (3) from a more path-dependent to a more intentionally managed network. Thus, this paper suggests that both cohesive and sparse networks are conducive to firm performance when they are aligned with and address firms' evolving resource challenges.

This standard theory of perception is usually justified on evolutionary grounds: Those creatures that see more truly are ipso facto more fit. However, a closer examination of perceptual evolution using the tools of evolutionary game theory reveals that this standard assumption is incorrect. Perception has not evolved to report truth, but instead to guide adaptive behavior within a niche. In this regard, our perceptions are much like the windows desktop of a computer, which serves to guide useful interactions with the computer while sparing the user from having to know the truth of its structure and function. This understanding of perceptual evolution requires us to replace the standard definitions of illusion and hallucination with new ones that better reflect the central role of perception as a guide to adaptive behavior.},

  abstract = {A great variety of systems in nature, society and technology -- from the web of sexual contacts to the Internet, from the nervous system to power grids -- can be modeled as graphs of vertices coupled by edges. The network structure, describing how the graph is wired, helps us understand, predict and optimize the behavior of dynamical systems. In many cases, however, the edges are not continuously active. As an example, in networks of communication via email, text messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or practically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for non-negligible periods of time: e.g., the proximity patterns of inpatients at hospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals is on throughout the time they are at the same ward. Like network topology, the temporal structure of edge activations can affect dynamics of systems interacting through the network, from disease contagion on the network of patients to information diffusion over an e-mail network. In this review, we present the emergent field of temporal networks, and discuss methods for analyzing topological and temporal structure and models for elucidating their relation to the behavior of dynamical systems. In the light of traditional network theory, one can see this framework as moving the information of when things happen from the dynamical system on the network, to the network itself. Since fundamental properties, such as the transitivity of edges, do not necessarily hold in temporal networks, many of these methods need to be quite different from those for static networks.},

Primary cortical locations agree well with previously published data and provide cortical localization in greater detail than previous studies. Variability of cortical electrode location was substantial in some cases and not related to cranial asymmetry. The results indicate that CT scanning or other neuroimaging techniques which reveal detailed cerebral anatomy would be potentially highly useful in defining the generators of electrocerebral potentials recorded from the scalp.},

In some forms of sensory adaptation, these linear filters and gain curve adjust very rapidly to changes in the variance of a randomly varying driving input. An apparently similar but previously unrelated issue is the observation of gain control by background noise in cortical neurons: the slope of the firing rate versus current (f-I) curve changes with the variance of background random input. Here, we show a direct correspondence between these two observations by relating variance-dependent changes in the gain of f-I curves to characteristics of the changing empirical linear/nonlinear model obtained by sampling. In the case that the underlying system is fixed, we derive relationships relating the change of the gain with respect to both mean and variance with the receptive fields derived from reverse correlation on a white noise stimulus. Using two conductance-based model neurons that display distinct gain modulation properties through a simple change in parameters, we show that coding properties of both these models quantitatively satisfy the predicted relationships. Our results describe how both variance-dependent gain modulation and adaptive neural computation result from intrinsic nonlinearity.},

We compared global and regional T1 measures (CC volume, and CC density), and the DTI measures [fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), average fiber length (AFL), and fiber number (FN)] of transcallosal fibers, between the two groups. We also evaluated the relationships between scores on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and CC T1 or DTI measurements. Significantly less white matter density in the anterior third of the CC, and higher ADC and lower FN values of the anterior third transcallosal fiber tracts were found in HFA patients compared to TD children. These results suggested that the anterior third CC density and transcallosal fiber connectivity were affected in HFA children.},

Estimates of rates of suicide and risk factors associated with later suicide were identified, and the risk factors were grouped according to type and strength of association with suicide. Consensus on the lifetime risk of suicide was a rate of approximately 5\%. Risk factors with a strong association with later suicide included being young, male, and with a high level of education. Illness-related risk factors were important predictors, with number of prior suicide attempts, depressive symptoms, active hallucinations and delusions, and the presence of insight all having a strong evidential basis. A family history of suicide, and comorbid substance misuse were also positively associated with later suicide. The only consistent protective factor for suicide was delivery of and adherence to effective treatment. Prevention of suicide in schizophrenia will rely on identifying those individuals at risk, and treating comorbid depression and substance misuse, as well as providing best available treatment for psychotic symptoms.},

  abstract = {It is commonplace to encounter heterogeneous or nonstationary data, of which the underlying generating process changes across domains or over time. Such a distribution shift feature presents both challenges and opportunities for causal discovery. In this paper, we develop a framework for causal discovery from such data, called Constraint-based causal Discovery from heterogeneous/NOnstationary Data (CD-NOD), to find causal skeleton and directions and estimate the properties of mechanism changes. First, we propose an enhanced constraintbased procedure to detect variables whose local mechanisms change and recover the skeleton of the causal structure over observed variables. Second, we present a method to determine causal orientations by making use of independent changes in the data distribution implied by the underlying causal model, benefiting from information carried by changing distributions. After learning the causal structure, next, we investigate how to efficiently estimate the ``driving force'' of the nonstationarity of a causal mechanism. That is, we aim to extract from data a low-dimensional representation of changes. The proposed methods are nonparametric, with no hard restrictions on data distributions and causal mechanisms, and do not rely on window segmentation. Furthermore, we find that data heterogeneity benefits causal structure identification even with particular types of confounders. Finally, we show the connection between heterogeneity/nonstationarity and soft intervention in causal discovery. Experimental results on various synthetic and real-world data sets (task-fMRI and stock market data) are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.},

Although synesthesia is often referred to as a "neurological condition," it is not listed in the DSM IV or the ICD classifications, as it generally does not interfere with normal daily functioning. However, its high prevalence rate (one in 23) means that synesthesia may be reported by patients who present with other psychiatric symptoms. In this review, I focus on recent research examining the neural basis of the two most intensively studied forms of synesthesia, grapheme --{$>$} color synesthesia and tone --{$>$} color synesthesia. These data suggest that these forms of synesthesia are elicited through anomalous activation of color-selective areas, perhaps in concert with hyperbinding mediated by the parietal cortex. I then turn to questions for future research and the implications of these models for other forms of synesthesia.},

In our discussion of the literature, we have focussed on two questions: (1) What sorts of things are said to be, respectively, causing and caused within the context of downward causation? And (2) What is the meaning of 'causing' in downward causation? We have concluded that the concept of 'downward causation' is muddled with regard to the meaning of causation and fuzzy with regard to the nature of the causes and the effects. Moreover, we have concluded that 'causation' in respect of 'downward causation' is usually understood in terms of explanation and determination rather than in terms of causation in the sense of 'bringing about'. Thus, the term 'downward causation' is badly chosen. \textcopyright{} Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.},

Those accounts prove to be more objective than usual accounts in terms of levels of mereology, which often face objections of being too epistemic. The present paper defends computational accounts against some objections, and develops what such notions bring to the usual idea of unpredictability. I distinguish the objective unpredictability, compatible with determinism and entailed by emergence, and various possibilities of predictability at emergent levels. This makes sense of practices common in complex systems studies that forge qualitative predictions on the basis of comparisons of simulations with multiple values of parameters. I consider robustness analysis as a way to ensure the ontological character of computational emergence. Finally, I focus on the property of novelty, as it is displayed by biological evolution, and ask whether computer simulations of evolution can produce the same kind of emergence as the open-ended evolution attested in Phanerozoic records. \textcopyright{} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The Normal approximation to the Binomial distribution underpins a range of statistical tests and methods, including the calculation of accurate confidence intervals, performing goodness of fit and contingency tests, line- and model-fitting, and computational methods based upon these. A common mistake is in assuming that, since the probable distribution of error about the ``true value'' in the population is approximately Normally distributed, the same can be said for the error about an observation. This paper is divided into two parts: fundamentals and evaluation. First, we examine the estimation of confidence intervals using three initial approaches: the ``Wald'' (Normal) interval, the Wilson score interval and the ``exact'' Clopper-Pearson Binomial interval. Whereas the first two can be calculated directly from formula...},

Many philosophers and cognitive scientists now acknowledge the critical importance of situated, environment-involving embodied engagements as a means of understanding basic minds -- including basic forms of human mentality. Yet many of these same theorists hold fast to the view that basic minds are necessarily or essentially contentful -- that they represent conditions the world might be in. In this book, Daniel Hutto and Erik Myin promote the cause of a radically enactive, embodied approach to cognition that holds that some kinds of minds -- basic minds -- are neither best explained by processes involving the manipulation of contents nor inherently contentful. Hutto and Myin oppose the widely endorsed thesis that cognition always and everywhere involves content. They defend the counter-thesis that there can be intentionality and phenomenal experience without content, and demonstrate the advantages of their approach for thinking about scaffolded minds and consciousness},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Poldrack (2006) rightly criticized the careless use of reverse inference. As a consequence, reverse inference is assumed as intrinsically weak by many and its validity has been increasingly regarded as limited. Although it is undisputed that the careless use of reverse inference is a problematic practice, the current view of reverse inference is to the author's opinion overly pessimistic. The present manuscript provides a revised formulation of reverse inference that includes an additional conditional constraint that has been previously acknowledged, but so far not implemented: the task-setting. This revised formulation I.) reveals that reverse inference can have high predictive power (as demonstrated by an example estimation) and II.) allows an estimation of reverse inference on the basis of meta-analyses instead of large-scale databases. It is concluded that reverse inference cannot be disregarded as a fallacy per se. Rather, the predictive power of reverse inference can even be "decisive"-dependent on the cognitive process of interest, the specific brain region activated, and the task-setting used. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The method is especially useful for finding sources of rhythmic activity. Furthermore, we propose to use a complex mixing matrix to model sources which are spatially extended and have different phases in different EEG/MEG channels. Simulations with artificial data and experiments on resting-state MEG demonstrate the utility of the method.},

There is a range of connection probabilities for which neuron firing occurs, as well as a critical probability for which the firing ceases in the absence of time delay. The critical probability for nonlocal shortcuts depends on the network size according to a power-law.

A total of 23 patients (36 feet; 3.2\%) developed a rocker bottom deformity. It is these patients that we have studied. The pathoanatomy of the rocker bottom deformity is characterised by a plantar convexity appearing between three and six months of age with the hindfoot equinus position remaining constant. The convexity initially involves the medial column, radiologically identified by the talo-first metatarsal angle and secondly by the lateral column, revealed radiologically as the calcaneo-fifth metatarsal angle. The apex of the deformity is usually at the midtrasal with a dorsal calcaneocuboid subluxation. Ideal management of clubfoot deformity should avoid this complication, with adequate manipulation and splinting and early Achilles' percutaneous tenotomy if plantar convexity occurs. Adequate soft-tissue release provides satisfactory correction for rocker bottom deformity. However, this deformity requires more extensive and complex procedures than the standard surgical treatment of clubfoot. The need for lateral radiographs to ensure that the rocker bottom deformity is recognised early, is demonstrated.},

One of the key advantages of optogenetics is that it can be used to control the activity of targeted neural pathways that connect specific brain regions. While such pathway-selective optogenetic control is a popular tool in rodents, attempts at modulating behaviour using pathway-selective optogenetics have not yet been successful in primates. Here we develop a methodology for pathway-selective optogenetics in macaque monkeys, focusing on the pathway from the frontal eye field (FEF) to the superior colliculus (SC), part of the complex oculomotor network. We find that the optogenetic stimulation of FEF projections to the SC modulates SC neuron activity and is sufficient to evoke saccadic eye movements towards the response field corresponding to the stimulation site. Thus, our results demonstrate the feasibility of using pathway-selective optogenetics to elucidate neural network function in primates.},

A signal for recall was presented against a background color throughout the test. Recalled items were classified as same- and different-context items according to whether the background colors at study and test were the same or different. Significant context effects were found in Experiments I and 2, in which two background colors were randomly alternated word by word. No context effects were found in Experiments 3 and 4, in which a common background color was presented for all items (Experiment 3) or for a number of successive items (Experiment 4). The results indicate that a change in background colors is necessary and sufficient to produce context effects. Implications of the present findings are discussed.},

One of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and ForceAtlas2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi users' typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

  abstract = {The first classification of general types of transition between phases of matter, introduced by Paul Ehrenfest in 1933, lies at a crossroads in the thermodynamical study of critical phenomena. It arose following the discovery in 1932 of a suprising new phase transition in liquid helium, the "lambda transition," when W. H. Keesom and coworkers in Leiden, Holland observed a {$\lambda$}-shaped "jump" discontinuity in the curve giving the temperature dependence of the specific heat of helium at a critical value. This apparent jump led Ehrenfest to introduce a classification of phase transitions on the basis of jumps in derivatives of the free energy function. This classification was immediately applied by A.J. Rutgers to the study of the transition from the normal to superconducting state in metals. Eduard Justi and Max von Laue soon questioned the possibility of its class of "second-order phase transitions" - of which the "lambda transition was believed to be the arche type - but C.J. Goiter and H.B.G. Casimir used an "order parameter to demonstrate their existence in superconductors. As a crossroads of study, the Ehrenfest classification was forced to undergo a slow, adaptive evolution during subsequent decades. During the 1940's the classification was increasingly used in discussions of liquid-gas, order-disorder, paramagnetic-ferromagnetic and normalsuper-conducting phase transitions. Already in 1944 however, Lars Onsager's solution of the Ising model for two-dimensional magnets was seen to possess a derivative with a logarithmic divergence rather than a jump as the critical point was approached. In the 1950's, experiments further revealed the lambda transition in helium to exhibit similar behavior. Rather than being a prime example of an Ehrenfest phase transition, the lambda transition was seen to lie outside the Ehrenfest classification. The Ehrenfest scheme was then extended to include such singularities, most notably by A. Brain Pippard in 1957, with widespread acceptance. During the 1960's these logarithmic infinities were the focus of the investigation of "scaling" by Leo Kadanoff, B. Widom and others. By the 1970s, a radically simplified binary classification of phase transitions into "first-order" and "continuous" transitions was increasingly adopted. \textcopyright{} Springer-Verlag 1998.}

We recently showed that the transfer entropy fails in a key aspect of this---measuring information flow---due to its conflation of dyadic and polyadic relationships. We extend this observation to demonstrate that this is true of all such Shannon information measures when used to analyze multivariate dependencies. This has broad implications, particularly when employing information to express the organization and mechanisms embedded in complex systems, including the burgeoning efforts to combine complex network theory with information theory. Here, we do not suggest that any aspect of information theory is wrong. Rather, the vast majority of its informational measures are simply inadequate for determining the meaningful dependency structure within joint probability distributions. Therefore, such information measures are inadequate for discovering intrinsic causal relations. We close by demonstrating that such distributions exist across an arbitrary set of variables.},

  abstract = {Information flow between components of a system takes many forms and is key to understanding the organization and functioning of large-scale, complex systems. We demonstrate three modalities of information flow from time series X to time series Y. Intrinsic information flow exists when the past of X is individually predictive of the present of Y, independent of Y's past; this is most commonly considered information flow. Shared information flow exists when X's past is predictive of Y's present in the same manner as Y's past; this occurs due to synchronization or common driving, for example. Finally, synergistic information flow occurs when neither X's nor Y's pasts are predictive of Y's present on their own, but taken together they are. The two most broadly-employed information-theoretic methods of quantifying information flow---time-delayed mutual information and transfer entropy---are both sensitive to a pair of these modalities: time-delayed mutual information to both intrinsic and shared flow, and transfer entropy to both intrinsic and synergistic flow. To quantify each mode individually we introduce our cryptographic flow ansatz, positing that intrinsic flow is synonymous with secret key agreement between X and Y. Based on this, we employ an easily-computed secret-key-agreement bound---intrinsic mutual information\&mdashto quantify the three flow modalities in a variety of systems including asymmetric flows and financial markets.},

Unfortunately, the PID framework has been hindered by a lack of a generally agreed-upon, multivariate method of quantifying the constituents. Here, we take a step toward rectifying this by developing a decomposition based on a new method that quantifies unique information. We first develop a broadly applicable method - the dependency decomposition - that delineates how statistical dependencies influence the structure of a joint distribution. The dependency decomposition then allows us to define a measure of the information about a target that can be uniquely attributed to a particular source as the least amount which the source-target statistical dependency can influence the information shared between the sources and the target. The result is the first measure that satisfies the core axioms of the PID framework while not satisfying the Blackwell relation, which depends on a particular interpretation of how the variables are related. This makes a key step forward to a practical PID.},

  abstract = {Learning how to recognize and anticipate the legal risks associated with student affairs practice is a crucial skill all successful administrators must develop. This can be done by developing a sense for scanning the broad legal environment and being aware of legal issues in other parts of the education enterprise. Good professionals make a considerable effort to remain current in their career fields. Professional associations assist their members in this task by developing training and professional development programs that address the critical skills that professionals need to do their jobs. In higher education and student affairs, many practitioners acknowledge the importance of knowing how the law affects what they do. Constitutional law affects what kinds of rules and regulations public institutions promulgate. Contract law affects the type of business relationship administrators have with students and other constituents. Tort law affects how managers maintain facilities and supervise student events. As a result, professional associations have been created to focus attention solely on legal issues in higher education (e.g., Education Law Association and the Association for Interdisciplinary Initiatives in Higher Education Law and Policy), programs on a wide variety of legal topics appear on almost every national conference schedule, many professional associations devote part of their Web sites to law and legislation (e.g., American College Personnel Association, National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, and the Association for Student Judicial Affairs), and private companies publish newsletters designed to inform their readers about the latest court rulings (e.g., The College Student and the Courts by Gehring and Letzring, Synfax weekly report by Pavela). Some of these resources examine events that may be several years old since litigation takes time and initial decisions may be appealed. Many of the authors of these publications restate the facts of the particular case and give some guidance on appropriate administrative practice. These resources, however, may not always be able to identify what administrators might face on their own campuses in the near future or define decision-making processes that might help administrators avoid legal pitfalls. The purpose of this paper is to identify two important mechanisms that college administrators can use to more actively anticipate the legal issues that may occur on their own campuses. First, practitioners should scan the broad legal environment. Secondly, they should be aware of legal issues in other parts of the education enterprise. Anticipating},

The objective is tackled by extending the standard (but little known:-) bgen bridge to be able to parse C++ headers, teaching it about C++ objects, inheritance and callbacks and exposing the result as a Py- thon extension module. There are various other solutions that allow you to automatically generate Python interfaces to C++ li- braries, but I could not find any that I really liked: most are lacking in functionality, such as bidirectional subclassing, some are bloatware, some are ugly. So in good open source tradition I decided to try and do better.

Given the joint distribution on all these variables, the DAG contains all information about how intervening on one variable changes the distribution of the other n-1 variables. However, quantifying the causal influence of one variable on another one remains a nontrivial question. Here we propose a set of natural, intuitive postulates that a measure of causal strength should satisfy. We then introduce a communication scenario, where edges in a DAG play the role of channels that can be locally corrupted by interventions. Causal strength is then the relative entropy distance between the old and the new distribution. Many other measures of causal strength have been proposed, including average causal effect, transfer entropy, directed information, and information flow. We explain how they fail to satisfy the postulates on simple DAGs of {$\leq$} 3 nodes. Finally, we investigate the behavior of our measure on time-series, supporting our claims with experiments on simulated data.},

This way, we obtain a measure of influence that quantifies the contribution of each node in its 'normal operation mode'. The total uncertainty of a target variable (measured in terms of variance or Shannon entropy) can then be attributed to the information from each noise term via Shapley values.

This will lead to many opportunities for brain research, but it will also pose challenges. Here we identify some of these opportunities and challenges in light of recent and foreseeable technological advances and offer some suggestions. Our main focus is on the creation of new primate disease models for understanding the pathological mechanisms of brain disorders and for developing new approaches to effective treatment. However, we also emphasize that primate genetic models have great potential to address many fundamental questions about brain function, providing an essential foundation for future progress in disease research.},

  abstract = {The progression of game theory from classical to evolutionary and spatial games provided a powerful means to study cooperation, and enabled a better understanding of general cooperation-promoting mechanisms. However, current standard models assume that at any given point players must choose either cooperation or defection, meaning that regardless of the spatial structure in which they exist, they cannot differentiate between their neighbours and adjust their behaviour accordingly. This is at odds with interactions among organisms in nature who are well capable of behaving differently towards different members of their communities. We account for this natural fact by introducing a new type of player\textemdash dubbed link players\textemdash who can adjust their behaviour to each individual neighbour. This is in contrast to more common node players whose behaviour affects all neighbours in the same way. We proceed to study cooperation in pure and mixed populations, showing that cooperation peaks at moderately low densities of link players. In such conditions, players naturally specialize in different roles. Node players tend to be either cooperators or defectors, while link players form social insulation between cooperative and defecting clusters by acting both as cooperators and defectors. Such fairly complex processes emerging from a simple model reflect some of the complexities observed in experimental studies on social behaviour in microbes and pave a way for the development of richer game models.},

We suggest that the replay phenomenon, in which ensembles of hippocampal neurons replay previously experienced firing sequences during subsequent rest and sleep, may provide practice sequences to improve the speed of TDRL learning, even within a single session. We test the plausibility of this hypothesis in a computational model of a multiple-T choice-task. Rats show two learning rates on this task: a fast decrease in errors and a slow development of a stereotyped path. Adding developing replay to the model accelerates learning the correct path, but slows down the stereotyping of that path. These models provide testable predictions relating the effects of hippocampal inactivation as well as hippocampal replay on this task. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We note commonalities between this rational approach and other movements in psychology - namely, Behaviorism and evolutionary psychology - that set aside mechanistic explanations or make use of optimality assumptions. Through these comparisons, we identify a number of challenges that limit the rational program's potential contribution to psychological theory. Specifically, rational Bayesian models are significantly unconstrained, both because they are uninformed by a wide range of process-level data and because their assumptions about the environment are generally not grounded in empirical measurement. The psychological implications of most Bayesian models are also unclear. Bayesian inference itself is conceptually trivial, but strong assumptions are often embedded in the hypothesis sets and the approximation algorithms used to derive model predictions, without a clear delineation between psychological commitments and implementational details. Comparing multiple Bayesian models of the same task is rare, as is the realization that many Bayesian models recapitulate existing (mechanistic level) theories. Despite the expressive power of current Bayesian models, we argue they must be developed in conjunction with mechanistic considerations to offer substantive explanations of cognition. We lay out several means for such an integration, which take into account the representations on which Bayesian inference operates, as well as the algorithms and heuristics that carry it out. We argue this unification will better facilitate lasting contributions to psychological theory, avoiding the pitfalls that have plagued previous theoretical movements.},

  abstract = {Methods of dimensionality reduction provide a way to understand and visualize the structure of complex data sets. Traditional methods like principal component analysis and classical metric multidimensional scaling suffer from being based on linear models. Until recently, very few methods were able to reduce the data dimensionality in a nonlinear way. However, since the late nineties, many new methods have been developed and nonlinear dimensionality reduction, also called manifold learning, has become a hot topic. New advances that account for this rapid growth are, e.g. the use of graphs to represent the manifold topology, and the use of new metrics like the geodesic distance. In addition, new optimization schemes, based on kernel techniques and spectral decomposition, have lead to spectral embedding, which encompasses many of the recently developed methods. This book describes existing and advanced methods to reduce the dimensionality of numerical databases. For each method, the description starts from intuitive ideas, develops the necessary mathematical details, and ends by outlining the algorithmic implementation. Methods are compared with each other with the help of different illustrative examples. The purpose of the book is to summarize clear facts and ideas about well-known methods as well as recent developments in the topic of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. With this goal in mind, methods are all described from a unifying point of view, in order to highlight their respective strengths and shortcomings. The book is primarily intended for statisticians, computer scientists and data analysts. It is also accessible to other practitioners having a basic background in statistics and/or computational learning, like psychologists (in psychometry) and economists.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in network theory have allowed for the study of the structure and function of the human brain in terms of a network of interconnected components. Among the many nodes that form a network, some play a crucial role and are said to be central within the network structure. Central nodes may be identified via centrality metrics, with degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality being three of the most popular measures. Degree identifies the most connected nodes, whereas betweenness centrality identifies those located on the most traveled paths. Eigenvector centrality considers nodes connected to other high degree nodes as highly central. In the work presented here, we propose a new centrality metric called leverage centrality that considers the extent of connectivity of a node relative to the connectivity of its neighbors. The leverage centrality of a node in a network is determined by the extent to which its immediate neighbors rely on that node for information. Although similar in concept, there are essential differences between eigenvector and leverage centrality that are discussed in this manuscript. Degree, betweenness, eigenvector, and leverage centrality were compared using functional brain networks generated from healthy volunteers. Functional cartography was also used to identify neighborhood hubs (nodes with high degree within a network neighborhood). Provincial hubs provide structure within the local community, and connector hubs mediate connections between multiple communities. Leverage proved to yield information that was not captured by degree, betweenness, or eigenvector centrality and was more accurate at identifying neighborhood hubs. We propose that this metric may be able to identify critical nodes that are highly influential within the network.},

To understand the full scope of this capacity, it is essential to know how neurons choose particular partners to form synaptic connections. By using multineuron whole-cell recordings and confocal microscopy we found that axons of layer V neocortical pyramidal neurons do not preferentially project toward the dendrites of particular neighboring pyramidal neurons; instead, axons promiscuously touch all neighboring dendrites without any bias. Functional synaptic coupling of a small fraction of these neurons is, however, correlated with the existence of synaptic boutons at existing touch sites. These data provide the first direct experimental evidence for a tabula rasa-like structural matrix between neocortical pyramidal neurons and suggests that pre- and postsynaptic interactions shape the conversion between touches and synapses to form specific functional microcircuits. These data also indicate that the local neocortical microcircuit has the potential to be differently rewired without the need for remodeling axonal or dendritic arbors.},

Physiological similarity to mammals, ease of genetic manipulations, sensitivity to pharmacological and genetic factors, robust behavior, low cost, and potential for high-throughput screening contribute to the growing utility of zebrafish models in this field. Understanding zebrafish behavioral phenotypes provides important insights into neural pathways, physiological biomarkers, and genetic underpinnings of normal and pathological brain function. Novel zebrafish paradigms continue to appear with an encouraging pace, thus necessitating a consistent terminology and improved understanding of the behavioral repertoire. What can zebrafish 'do', and how does their altered brain function translate into behavioral actions? To help address these questions, we have developed a detailed catalog of zebrafish behaviors (Zebrafish Behavior Catalog, ZBC) that covers both larval and adult models. Representing a beginning of creating a more comprehensive ethogram of zebrafish behavior, this effort will improve interpretation of published findings, foster cross-species behavioral modeling, and encourage new groups to apply zebrafish neurobehavioral paradigms in their research. In addition, this glossary creates a framework for developing a zebrafish neurobehavioral ontology, ultimately to become part of a unified animal neurobehavioral ontology, which collectively will contribute to better integration of biological data within and across species.},

We find that the society elite, corresponding to the top PageRank nodes, can impose its opinion on a significant fraction of the society. However, for a homogeneous distribution of two opinions, there exists a bistability range of opinions which depends on a conformist parameter characterizing the opinion formation. We find that the LiveJournal and Twitter networks have a stronger tendency to a totalitarian opinion formation than the university networks.

Controlling which stimulus is attended thus originates from neurons encoding the relevance of stimuli, i.e. their expected value, in hand with neurons encoding contextual information about stimulus locations, features, and rules that guide the conditional allocation of attention. Here, we examined how these distinct processes are encoded and integrated in macaque prefrontal cortex (PFC) by mapping their functional topographies at the time of attentional stimulus selection. We find confined clusters of neurons in ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) that predominantly convey stimulus valuation information during attention shifts. These valuation signals were topographically largely separated from neurons predicting the stimulus location to which attention covertly shifted, and which were evident across the complete medial-to-lateral extent of the PFC, encompassing anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and lateral PFC (LPFC). LPFC responses showed particularly early-onset selectivity and primarily facilitated attention shifts to contralateral targets. Spatial selectivity within ACC was delayed and heterogeneous, with similar proportions of facilitated and suppressed responses during contralateral attention shifts. The integration of spatial and valuation signals about attentional target stimuli was observed in a confined cluster of neurons at the intersection of vmPFC, ACC, and LPFC. These results suggest that valuation processes reflecting stimulus-specific outcome predictions are recruited during covert attentional control. Value predictions and the spatial identification of attentional targets were conveyed by largely separate neuronal populations, but were integrated locally at the intersection of three major prefrontal areas, which may constitute a functional hub within the larger attentional control network.},

We encode this observation in a reinforcement process defining a time-varying network model that exhibits the emergence of strong and weak ties. We study the effect of time-varying and heterogeneous interactions on the classic rumour spreading model in both synthetic, and real-world networks. We observe that strong ties severely inhibit information diffusion by confining the spreading process among agents with recurrent communication patterns. This provides the counterintuitive evidence that strong ties may have a negative role in the spreading of information across networks.},

Using two different hyperbolic embedding methods, hydra+ and Mercator, this allows us to connect the network structure to the popularity-vs-similarity model of Papdopoulos et al., which is based on the Poincar\'e disc model of hyperbolic geometry. We show that the latent dimensions of `popularity' and `similarity' in this model are strongly associated to systemic importance and to geographic subdivisions of the banking system, independent of the embedding method that is used. In a longitudinal analysis over the time span from 2014 to 2018 we find that the systemic importance of individual banks has remained rather stable, while the peripheral community structure exhibits more (but still moderate) variability. Based on our analysis we argue that embeddings into hyperbolic geometry can be used to monitor structural change in financial networks and are able to distinguish between changes in systemic relevance and other (peripheral) structural changes.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous cortical activity--ongoing activity in the absence of intentional sensory input--has been studied extensively, using methods ranging from EEG (electroencephalography), through voltage sensitive dye imaging, down to recordings from single neurons. Ongoing cortical activity has been shown to play a critical role in development, and must also be essential for processing sensory perception, because it modulates stimulus-evoked activity, and is correlated with behaviour. Yet its role in the processing of external information and its relationship to internal representations of sensory attributes remains unknown. Using voltage sensitive dye imaging, we previously established a close link between ongoing activity in the visual cortex of anaesthetized cats and the spontaneous firing of a single neuron. Here we report that such activity encompasses a set of dynamically switching cortical states, many of which correspond closely to orientation maps. When such an orientation state emerged spontaneously, it spanned several hypercolumns and was often followed by a state corresponding to a proximal orientation. We suggest that dynamically switching cortical states could represent the brain's internal context, and therefore reflect or influence memory, perception and behaviour.},

  abstract = {Abstract This is an introduction to the special issue titled "Networks of networks" that is in the making at Chaos, Solitons \& Fractals. Recent research and reviews attest to the fact that networks of networks are the next frontier in network science [1-7]. Not only are interactions limited and thus inadequately described by well-mixed models, it is also a fact that the networks that should be an integral part of such models are often interconnected, thus making the processes that are unfolding on them interdependent. From the World economy and transportation systems to social media, it is clear that processes taking place in one network might significantly affect what is happening in many other networks. Within an interdependent system, each type of interaction has a certain relevance and meaning, so that treating all the links identically inevitably leads to information loss. Networks of networks, interdependent networks, or multilayer networks are therefore a much better and realistic description of such systems, and this Special Issue is devoted to their structure, dynamics and evolution, as well as to the study of emergent properties in multi-layered systems in general. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the spread of epidemics and information, percolation, diffusion, synchronization, collective behavior, and evolutionary games on networks of networks. Interdisciplinary work on all aspects of networks of networks, regardless of background and motivation, is very welcome.}

Yet, our understanding of how this process unfolds in real-world networks remains underdeveloped. This paper explores this gap through a case study of al-Muhajiroun, an activist network that continues to call for the establishment of an Islamic state in Britain despite being formally outlawed by British authorities. Drawing on organisation theory and social network analysis, we formulate three hypotheses regarding the learning capacity and social network properties of al-Muhajiroun (AM) and its successor groups. We then test these hypotheses using mixed methods. Our methods combine quantitative analysis of three agent-based networks in AM measured for structural properties that facilitate learning, including connectedness, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality, with qualitative analysis of interviews with AM activists focusing organisational adaptation and learning. The results of these analyses confirm that al-Muhajiroun activists respond to government pressure by changing their operations, including creating new platforms under different names and adjusting leadership roles among movement veterans to accommodate their spiritual leader's unwelcome exodus to Lebanon. Simple as they are effective, these adaptations have allowed al-Muhajiroun and its successor groups to continue their activism in an increasingly hostile environment. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.},

In fact, the general contextual probability theory predicts not only quantum-like trigonometric (cos \texttheta ) interference of probabilities, but also hyperbolic (cosh \texttheta ) interference of probabilities (as well as hyper-trigonometric). In principle, statistical data obtained in experiments with cognitive systems can produce hyperbolic (cosh \texttheta ) interference of probabilities. We introduce a wave function of (e.g., human) population. In general, we should not reject the possibility that cognitive functioning is neither quantum nor classical. We discuss the structure of state spaces for cognitive systems.}

Quantum-like (QL) models, i.e. models based on the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics and their generalizations can be successfully applied to cognitive science, psychology, genetics, economics, finances, and game theory.This book is not about quantum mechanics as a physical theory. The short review of quantum postulates is therefore mainly of historical value: quantum mechanics is just the first example of the successful application of non-Kolmogorov probabilities, the first step towards a contextual probabilistic description of natural, biological, psychological, social, economical or financial phenomena. A general contextual probabilistic model (V model) is presented. It can be used for describing probabilities in both quantum and classical (statistical) mechanics as well as in the above mentioned phenomena. This model can be represented in a quantum-like way, namely, in complex and more general Hilbert spaces. In this way quantum probability is totally demystified: Born's representation of quantum probabilities by complex probability amplitudes, wave functions, is simply a special representation of this type. \textcopyright{} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

Following an intuitive description of the model, we discuss six recent studies, which use DCM to analyze M/EEG and local field potentials. These studies illustrate how DCM can be used to analyze evoked responses (average response in time), induced responses (average response in time-frequency), and steady-state responses (average response in frequency). Bayesian model comparison plays a critical role in these analyses, by allowing one to compare equally plausible models in terms of their model evidence. This approach might be very useful in M/EEG research; where correlations among spatial and neuronal model parameter estimates can cause uncertainty about which model best explains the data. Bayesian model comparison resolves these uncertainties in a principled and formal way. We suggest that DCM and Bayesian model comparison provides a useful way to test hypotheses about distributed processing in the brain, using electromagnetic data.},

These studies often require participants to link task instructions with task cues signaling the need (or lack thereof) for cognitive control. Thus, the oscillatory response elicited by these cues may also reflect the implementation of explicit task instructions. The aim of this research was to determine whether gamma-band oscillations would also be increased in preparation for cognitive control when the need for that control was only made implicitly available to the participant. Using a task-ambiguous cue to indicate the position of a subsequent probe stimulus, we manipulated the need for cognitive control by varying the probability of high- and low-control probes appearing in each of two positions. Results show that participants developed the anticipated expectancies regarding probe identity in the two positions and that the anticipation of a high-control probe was associated with an increase in the power of induced cortical gamma band over frontal scalp recording sites.},

For this, ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles, including monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles, can be used as long-half-life, intravascular susceptibility agents of CBV MRI measurements. Moreover, CBV-weighted functional MRI (fMRI) with USPIO nanoparticles provides enhanced sensitivity, reduced large vessel contribution and improved spatial specificity relative to conventional blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI, and measures a single physiological parameter that is easily interpretable. We review the physiochemical and magnetic properties, and pharmacokinetics, of USPIO nanoparticles in brief. We then extensively discuss quantifications of baseline CBV, vessel size index and functional CBV change. We also provide reviews of dose-dependent sensitivity, vascular filter function, specificity, characteristics and impulse response function of CBV fMRI. Examples of CBV fMRI specificity at the laminar and columnar resolution are provided. Finally, we briefly review the application of CBV measurements to functional and pharmacological studies in animals. Overall, the use of USPIO nanoparticles can determine baseline CBV and its changes induced by functional activity and pharmacological interventions.},

  abstract = {Networked systems display complex patterns of interactions between components. In physical networks, these interactions often occur along structural connections that link components in a hard-wired connection topology, supporting a variety of system-wide dynamical behaviours such as synchronization. Although descriptions of these behaviours are important, they are only a first step towards understanding and harnessing the relationship between network topology and system behaviour. Here, we use linear network control theory to derive accurate closed-form expressions that relate the connectivity of a subset of structural connections (those linking driver nodes to non-driver nodes) to the minimum energy required to control networked systems. To illustrate the utility of the mathematics, we apply this approach to high-resolution connectomes recently reconstructed from Drosophila, mouse, and human brains. We use these principles to suggest an advantage of the human brain in supporting diverse network dynamics with small energetic costs while remaining robust to perturbations, and to perform clinically accessible targeted manipulation of the brain's control performance by removing single edges in the network. Generally, our results ground the expectation of a control system's behaviour in its network architecture, and directly inspire new directions in network analysis and design via distributed control. N etwork systems are composed of interconnected units that interact with each other on diverse temporal and spatial scales 1 . The exact patterns of interconnections between these units can take on many different forms that dictate how the system functions 2 . Indeed, specific features of network topology\textemdash such as small worldness 3 and modularity 4 \textemdash can improve efficiency and robustness. Yet, exact mechanisms driving the relationship between structure and function remain elusive, hampering the analysis, modification, and control of interconnected complex systems.

For this purpose, we developed a program using Labview software. Labview is an application development environment that uses a graphical language G, usable with an online applicable National Instruments data acquisition card. In order to obtain clinically interpretable results, frequency band activities of delta, theta, alpha and beta signals were mapped onto frequency-time axes using the STFT, and 3D WT representations were obtained using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Both results were compared, and it was determined that the STFT was more applicable for real-time processing of EEG signals, due to its short process time. However, the CWT still had good resolution and performance high enough for use in clinical and research settings.},

However, identifying power law scaling in empirical data can be difficult and sometimes controversial. In the present study, we tested the power law hypothesis for neuronal avalanches by using more stringent statistical analyses. In particular, we performed the following steps: (i) analysis of finite-size scaling to identify scale-free dynamics in neuronal avalanches, (ii) model parameter estimation to determine the specific exponent of the power law, and (iii) comparison of the power law to alternative model distributions. Consistent with critical state dynamics, avalanche size distributions exhibited robust scaling behavior in which the maximum avalanche size was limited only by the spatial extent of sampling ("finite size" effect). This scale-free dynamics suggests the power law as a model for the distribution of avalanche sizes. Using both the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and a maximum likelihood approach, we found the slope to be close to -1.5, which is in line with previous reports. Finally, the power law model for neuronal avalanches was compared to the exponential and to various heavy-tail distributions based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance and by using a log-likelihood ratio test. Both the power law distribution without and with exponential cut-off provided significantly better fits to the cluster size distributions in neuronal avalanches than the exponential, the lognormal and the gamma distribution. In summary, our findings strongly support the power law scaling in neuronal avalanches, providing further evidence for critical state dynamics in superficial layers of cortex.},

  abstract = {Predicting the future state of a turbulent dynamical system such as the atmosphere has been recognized for several decades to be an essentially statistical undertaking. Uncertainties from a variety of sources are magnified by dynamical mechanisms and given sufficient time, compromise any prediction. In the last decade or so this process of uncertainty evolution has been studied using a variety of tools from information theory. These provide both a conceptually general view of the problem as well as a way of probing its non-linearity. Here we review these advances from both a theoretical and practical perspective. Connections with other theoretical areas such as statistical mechanics are emphasized. The importance of obtaining practical results for prediction also guides the development presented.},

These networks allow elegant computations that are thought to represent a number of aspects of brain function. Although there is good reason to believe that the brain displays attractor dynamics, it has proven difficult to test experimentally whether any particular attractor architecture resides in any particular brain circuit. We review models and experimental evidence for three systems in the rat brain that are presumed to be components of the rat's navigational and memory system. Head-direction cells have been modeled as a ring attractor, grid cells as a plane attractor, and place cells both as a plane attractor and as a point attractor. Whereas the models have proven to be extremely useful conceptual tools, the experimental evidence in their favor, although intriguing, is still mostly circumstantial.},

We found that the combined spatial expression patterns of 170 neuron-specific transcripts revealed strikingly clear and symmetrical signatures for most of the brain's major subdivisions. Moreover, the brain expression spatial signatures correspond to anatomical structures and may even reflect developmental ontogeny. Spatial expression profiles of astrocyte- and oligodendrocyte-specific genes also revealed regional differences; these defined fewer regions and were less distinct but still symmetrical in the coronal plane. Follow-up analysis suggested that region-based clustering of neuron-specific genes was related to (i) a combination of individual genes with restricted expression patterns, (ii) region-specific differences in the relative expression of functional groups of genes, and (iii) regional differences in neuronal density. Products from some of these neuron-specific genes are present in peripheral blood, raising the possibility that they could reflect the activities of disease- or injury-perturbed networks and collectively function as biomarkers for clinical disease diagnostics.},

Of central interest is whether emotions play a causal role in moral judgement, and, in parallel, how emotion-related areas of the brain contribute to moral judgement. Here we show that six patients with focal bilateral damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC), a brain region necessary for the normal generation of emotions and, in particular, social emotions, produce an abnormally 'utilitarian' pattern of judgements on moral dilemmas that pit compelling considerations of aggregate welfare against highly emotionally aversive behaviours (for example, having to sacrifice one person's life to save a number of other lives). In contrast, the VMPC patients' judgements were normal in other classes of moral dilemmas. These findings indicate that, for a selective set of moral dilemmas, the VMPC is critical for normal judgements of right and wrong. The findings support a necessary role for emotion in the generation of those judgements.},

Both systems are trained on a large data set of around 45,000 images and results show the CNN outperforms the traditional CAD system at low sensitivity and performs comparable at high sensitivity. We subsequently investigate to what extent features such as location and patient information and commonly used manual features can still complement the network and see improvements at high specificity over the CNN especially with location and context features, which contain information not available to the CNN. Additionally, a reader study was performed, where the network was compared to certified screening radiologists on a patch level and we found no significant difference between the network and the readers.},

Whether qualia are amenable to scientific exploration has often been questioned, which is challenged by the present article. The following arguments are given: 1. the configuration of the brain changes continuously and irreversibly, because of genetic and environmental influences and interhuman communication; 2. qualia and consciousness are processes, rather than states; 3. private feelings, including those associated with qualia, should be positioned in the context of a personal brain as being developed during life; 4. consciousness and qualia should be understood in the context of general system theory, thus concluding that isolated, in vitro, properties of neurons and other brain constituents might marginally contribute to the understanding of higher brain functions, mind or qualia; 5. current in vivo approaches have too little resolution power - in terms of space and time - to delineate individual and subjective brain processes. When subtle personalized properties of the nervous system can be assessed in vivo or in vitro, qualia can scientifically be investigated. We discuss some approaches to overcome these barriers.},

We calculated the correlation dimension, which is a measure of the complexity of the dynamic system, as well as the first Lyapunov exponent that indicates the system's unpredictability. METHODS: The schizophrenic group consisted of 3 men and 7 women aged 23-32 years (mean 27.2, SD=3.5) and the control group of 3 men and 6 women aged 26-35 years (mean 31.6 +/- 4.1). There were no significant differences between the two groups as far as age and sex were concerned. None of them received any medication. RESULTS: The analysis of the MEG in the schizophrenic group showed lower dimension complexity and moreover the first Lyapunov exponent presented lower values compared with the corresponding ones in the control group, which means lower information processing. CONCLUSION: EEG findings as determined by MEG and non-linear analysis may offer important perspectives to better understand brain function in schizophrenia.},

It is widely appreciated that these models can generate random graphs that are small-world, highly clustered and scale-free at the same time; thus, reproducing the most fundamental common features of real networks. In the present work, we focus on a less well-known property of the popularity-similarity optimisation model and the                                                   \$\$\{\textbackslash mathbb \{S\}\}\^1/\{\textbackslash mathbb \{H\}\}\^2\$\$                                                                                                                   S                                                  1                                              /                                                                           H                                                  2                                                                                                              model from this model family, namely that the networks generated by these approaches also contain communities for a wide range of the parameters, which was certainly not an intention at the design of the models. We extracted the communities from the studied networks using well-established community finding methods such as Louvain, Infomap and label propagation. The observed high modularity values indicate that the community structure can become very pronounced under certain conditions. In addition, the modules found by the different algorithms show good consistency, implying that these are indeed relevant and apparent structural units. Since the appearance of communities is rather common in networks representing real systems as well, this feature of hyperbolic models makes them even more suitable for describing real networks than thought before.},

With the motivation of better understanding hyperbolic random graphs, we hereby introduce the               d               PSO model, a generalisation of the PSO model to any arbitrary integer dimension                                                   \$\$d{$>$}2\$\$                                                               d                       {$>$}                       2                                                                                       . The analysis of the obtained networks shows that their major structural properties can be affected by the dimension of the underlying hyperbolic space in a non-trivial way. Our extended framework is not only interesting from a theoretical point of view but can also serve as a starting point for the generalisation of already existing two-dimensional hyperbolic embedding techniques.},

  abstract = {Despite the near universal assumption of individuality in biology, there is little agreement about what individuals are and few rigorous quantitative methods for their identification. Here, we propose that individuals are aggregates that preserve a measure of temporal integrity, i.e., ``propagate'' information from their past into their futures. We formalize this idea using information theory and graphical models. This mathematical formulation yields three principled and distinct forms of individuality\textemdash an organismal, a colonial, and a driven form\textemdash each of which varies in the degree of environmental dependence and inherited information. This approach can be thought of as a Gestalt approach to evolution where selection makes figure-ground (agent\textendash environment) distinctions using suitable information-theoretic lenses. A benefit of the approach is that it expands the scope of allowable individuals to include adaptive aggregations in systems that are multi-scale, highly distributed, and do not necessarily have physical boundaries such as cell walls or clonal somatic tissue. Such individuals might be visible to selection but hard to detect by observers without suitable measurement principles. The information theory of individuality allows for the identification of individuals at all levels of organization from molecular to cultural and provides a basis for testing assumptions about the natural scales of a system and argues for the importance of uncertainty reduction through coarse-graining in adaptive systems.},

  abstract = {The avian retina possesses one of the most sophisticated cone photoreceptor systems among vertebrates. Birds have five types of cones including four single cones, which support tetrachromatic color vision and a double cone, which is thought to mediate achromatic motion perception. Despite this richness, very little is known about the spatial organization of avian cones and its adaptive significance. Here we show that the five cone types of the chicken independently tile the retina as highly ordered mosaics with a characteristic spacing between cones of the same type. Measures of topological order indicate that double cones are more highly ordered than single cones, possibly reflecting their posited role in motion detection. Although cones show spacing interactions that are cell type-specific, all cone types use the same densitydependent yardstick to measure intercone distance. We propose a simple developmental model that can account for these observations. We also show that a single parameter, the global regularity index, defines the regularity of all five cone mosaics. Lastly, we demonstrate similar cone distributions in three additional avian species, suggesting that these patterning principles are universal among birds. Since regular photoreceptor spacing is critical for uniform sampling of visual space, the cone mosaics of the avian retina represent an elegant example of the emergence of adaptive global patterning secondary to simple local interactions between individual photoreceptors. Our results indicate that the evolutionary pressures that gave rise to the avian retina's various adaptations for enhanced color discrimination also acted to fine-tune its spatial sampling of color and luminance.},

Often, the path from basic research to new paradigms and direct impact on society takes time. Precise quantification of scientific output in the short-term is not an easy task but is critical for evaluating scientists, laboratories, departments, and institutions. While there have been attempts to quantifying scientific output, we argue that current methods are not ideal and suffer from solvable difficulties. Here we propose criteria that a metric should have to be considered a good index of scientific output. Specifically, we argue that such an index should be quantitative, based on robust data, rapidly updated and retrospective, presented with confidence intervals, normalized by number of contributors, career stage and discipline, impractical to manipulate, and focused on quality over quantity. Such an index should be validated through empirical testing. The purpose of quantitatively evaluating scientific output is not to replace careful, rigorous review by experts but rather to complement those efforts. Because it has the potential to greatly influence the efficiency of scientific research, we have a duty to reflect upon and implement novel and rigorous ways of evaluating scientific output. The criteria proposed here provide initial steps toward the systematic development and validation of a metric to evaluate scientific output.},

Not only are depressive syndromes heterogeneous and their aetiologies diverse, but symptoms such as guilt and suicidality are impossible to reproduce in animal models. Nevertheless, other symptoms have been accurately modelled, and these, together with clinical data, are providing insight into the neurobiology of depression. Recent studies combining behavioural, molecular and electrophysiological techniques reveal that certain aspects of depression result from maladaptive stress-induced neuroplastic changes in specific neural circuits. They also show that understanding the mechanisms of resilience to stress offers a crucial new dimension for the development of fundamentally novel antidepressant treatments.},

Recently it has been proposed that the causal models used in human predictive processing are best formally modeled by categorical probability distributions. Crucially, such distributions assume a well-defined, discrete state space. In this paper we explore the consequences of this formalization. In particular we argue that the level of detail of generative models and predictions modulates prediction error. We show that both increasing the level of detail of the generative models and decreasing the level of detail of the predictions can be suitable mechanisms for lowering prediction errors. Both increase precision, yet come at the price of lowering the amount of information that can be gained by correct predictions. Our theoretical result establishes a key open empirical question to address: How does the brain optimize the trade-off between high precision and information gain when making its predictions?},

The motivation for its development is to be able to examine the role of neural synchronies as a putative mechanism for long-range neural integration during cognitive tasks. The method, called phase-locking statistics (PLS), measures the significance of the phase covariance between two signals with a reasonable time-resolution ({$<$}100 ms). Unlike the more traditional method of spectral coherence, PLS separates the phase and amplitude components and can be directly interpreted in the framework of neural integration. To validate synchrony values against background fluctuations, PLS uses surrogate data and thus makes no a priori assumptions on the nature of the experimental data. We also apply PLS to investigate intracortical recordings from an epileptic patient performing a visual discrimination task. We find large-scale synchronies in the gamma band (45 Hz), e.g., between hippocampus and frontal gyrus, and local synchronies, within a limbic region, a few cm apart. We argue that whereas long-scale effects do reflect cognitive processing, short-scale synchronies are likely to be due to volume conduction.

However, the activity of cortical neurons is not determined by this feedforward sweep alone. Horizontal connections within areas, and higher areas providing feedback, result in dynamic changes in tuning. The differences between feedforward and recurrent processing could prove pivotal in understanding the distinctions between attentive and pre-attentive vision as well as between conscious and unconscious vision. The feedforward sweep rapidly groups feature constellations that are hardwired in the visual brain, yet is probably incapable of yielding visual awareness; in many cases, recurrent processing is necessary before the features of an object are attentively grouped and the stimulus can enter consciousness.},

Each vertex of the network of interactions is characterized by a set of cultural features, each of which can assume a fixed number of states. Pairs of adjacent vertices interact at a rate proportional to the number of features they share, which results in the interacting pair having one more cultural feature in common. The Axelrod model has been extensively studied the past ten years based on numerical simulations and simple mean-field treatments while there is a total lack of analytical results for the spatial model. Numerical results emerging from spatial simulations of the one-dimensional system are difficult to interpret but suggest that (i) when the number of cultural features and the number of states per feature both equal two or (ii) when the number of features exceeds the number of states per feature, the system converges to a monocultural equilibrium in the sense that a single culture ultimately occupies a macroscopically large fraction of the graph while (iii) when the number of states per feature exceeds the number of features, the system freezes in a highly fragmented configuration. In this article, we prove analytically conjecture (i) in terms of a clustering of the infinite system, and part of conjecture (iii). Our first result also applies to the constrained voter model.},

Electroencephalography (EEG) still remains one of the most useful and effective tools in understanding and treatment of epilepsy. To this end, many computational methods have been devel-oped for both the detection and prediction of epileptic seizures. Techniques derived from linear/nonlinear analysis, chaos, information theory, morphological analysis, model-based analysis, all present different advantages, disadvantages, and limitations. Recently, there is the notion of selecting and combining the most robust features from different methods for revealing various signals' characteristics and making more reliable assumptions. Finally, intelligent classifiers are employed in order to distinguish epileptic state out of normal states. This chapter reviews the most widely adopted algorithms for the detection and prediction of epileptic seizures, emphasizing on information theory based and entropy indices. Each method's accuracy has been evaluated through performance measures, assessing the ability of automatic seizure detection/ prediction.},

Under what conditions might we expect physical systems to support such computational primitives? This paper presents research on cellular automata which suggests that the optimal conditions for the support of information transmission, storage, and modification, are achieved in the vicinity of a phase transition. We observe surprising similarities between the behaviors of computations and systems near phase transitions, finding analogs of computational complexity classes and the halting problem within the phenomenology of phase transitions. We conclude that there is a fundamental connection between computation and phase transitions, especially second-order or "critical" transitions, and discuss some of the implications for our understanding of nature if such a connection is borne out. \textcopyright{} 1990.},

  abstract = {Weak ties are thought to facilitate the diffusion of information through social networks because of their tendency to span otherwise distant subgroups. However, this logic assumes that weak relationships have the same capacity to transmit information as those that are strong. I argue that weak ties, especially the kind that span subgroups, are often also lower-capacity. Due to a lack of trust, an unwillingness to share benefits, or a limited ability to understand one another, an individual is less likely to share novel information across these ties. In standard models of diffusion imported from epidemiology, even reduced-capacity links would still aid diffusion. However, accounting for reduced capacity in a new model of diffusion that captures realistic features of information sharing in human groups, I demonstrate that hesitation to share across weak links substantially impedes overall diffusion. Moreover, I show that the addition of weak ties to a social network can strictly reduce the extent and speed of information diffusion. Increasing density by adding weak ties can make diffusion strictly worse by crowding out the use of higher-capacity ties. I present the results of simulated information diffusion on both hypothetical networks generated to possess varying levels of density and homophily, as well as on real social networks in two Ugandan villages shown to be responsible for face-to-face information sharing.},

It is only through the appropriate binding and integration of information from the different senses that a meaningful and accurate perceptual gestalt can be generated. Although a great deal is known about how such cross-modal interactions influence behavior and perception in the adult, there is little knowledge as to the impact of aging on these multisensory processes. In the current study, we examined the speed of discrimination responses of aged and young individuals to the presentation of visual, auditory or combined visual-auditory stimuli. Although the presentation of multisensory stimuli speeded response times in both groups, the performance gain was significantly greater in the aged. Most strikingly, multisensory stimuli restored response times in the aged to those seen in young subjects to the faster of the two unisensory stimuli (i.e., visual). The current results suggest that despite the decline in sensory processing that accompanies aging, the use of multiple sensory channels may represent an effective compensatory strategy to overcome these unisensory deficits.},

The spreading power of all network nodes is better explained by considering, from a continuous-time epidemiological perspective, the distribution of the force of infection each node generates. The resulting metric, the expected force, accurately quantifies node spreading power under all primary epidemiological models across a wide range of archetypical human contact networks. When node power is low, influence is a function of neighbor degree. As power increases, a node's own degree becomes more important. The strength of this relationship is modulated by network structure, being more pronounced in narrow, dense networks typical of social networking and weakening in broader, looser association networks such as the Internet. The expected force can be computed independently for individual nodes, making it applicable for networks whose adjacency matrix is dynamic, not well specified, or overwhelmingly large.},

We hypothesized that meditation practice might also be associated with changes in the brain's physical structure. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess cortical thickness in 20 participants with extensive Insight meditation experience, which involves focused attention to internal experiences. Brain regions associated with attention, interoception and sensory processing were thicker in meditation participants than matched controls, including the prefrontal cortex and right anterior insula. Between-group differences in prefrontal cortical thickness were most pronounced in older participants, suggesting that meditation might offset age-related cortical thinning. Finally, the thickness of two regions correlated with meditation experience. These data provide the first structural evidence for experience-dependent cortical plasticity associated with meditation practice.},

  abstract = {Energy-Based Models (EBMs) capture dependencies between variables by associating a scalar energy to each configuration of the variables. Inference consists in clamping the value of observed variables and finding configurations of the remaining variables that minimize the energy. Learning consists in finding an energy function in which observed configurations of the variables are given lower energies than unobserved ones. The EBM approach provides a common theoretical framework for many learning models, including traditional discriminative and generative approaches, as well as graph-transformer networks, conditional random fields, maximum margin Markov networks, and several manifold learning methods. Probabilistic models must be properly normalized, which sometimes requires evaluating intractable integrals over the space of all possible variable configurations. Since EBMs have no requirement for proper normalization, this problem is naturally circumvented. EBMs can be viewed as a form of non-probabilistic factor graphs, and they provide considerably more flexibility in the design of architectures and training criteria than probabilistic approaches.},

The approach shifts the focus from questions about whether emotions that humans consciously feel are also present in other animals, and toward questions about the extent to which circuits and corresponding functions that are present in other animals (survival circuits and functions) are also present in humans. Survival circuit functions are not causally related to emotional feelings but obviously contribute to these, at least indirectly. The survival circuit concept integrates ideas about emotion, motivation, reinforcement, and arousal in the effort to understand how organisms survive and thrive by detecting and responding to challenges and opportunities in daily life.},

This paper examines the perspectival nature of mechanistic explanation through the lens of the `mechanistic stance', which falls somewhere between Dennett's more familiar physical and design stance. We argue this approach implies three distinct and significant ways in which mechanistic explanation can be interpreted as perspectival: `phenomenon perspectivism', `pattern perspectivism' and `hierarchy perspectivism'. We evaluate the strength of the perspective-dependency implied by each of these, and along the way, discuss their significance for wider debates within the new mechanism literature, such as the nature of function attribution and an ontic vs epistemic understanding of explanation.},

As dimensionality was dependent on data set size, we determined asymptotic dimensionality as both the number of neurons and number of stimulus image approached infinity. Our final dimensionality estimate was 93 (SD: {$\pm$} 11), indicating that there is basis set of approximately a hundred independent features that characterize the dimensions of neural object space. We believe this is the first estimate of the dimensionality of neural visual representations based on single-cell neurophysiological data. The dimensionality of AIT object representations was much lower than the dimensionality of the stimuli. We suggest that there may be a gradual reduction in the dimensionality of object representations in neural populations going from retina to inferotemporal cortex, as receptive fields become increasingly complex.

The theta oscillation is a particularly prominent rhythm, reported to be present in many brain areas, and related to many important cognitive processes. The generating mechanisms of theta have extensively been studied and reviewed elsewhere; here we discuss ideas that have accumulated over the past decades on the computational roles it may subserve. Theories propose different aspects of theta oscillations as being relevant for their cognitive functions: limit cycle oscillations in neuronal firing rates, subthreshold membrane potential oscillations, periodic modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity, and phase precession of hippocampal place cells. The relevant experimental data is briefly summarized in the light of these theories. Specific models proposing a function for theta in pattern recognition, memory, sequence learning and navigation are reviewed critically. Difficulties with testing and comparing alternative models are discussed, along with potentially important future research directions in the field.},

Social ties still play an important role in the origin and growth of the majority of networks. Forums, however, also play a significant role in a number of networks, for example, to find suitable co-offenders or to get into contact with enablers.

Stochastic metastability was observed for a degenerate case in which both order parameters shared the same rates and initiated from the common deterministic fixed point. Near this unique state, fluctuations have been shown analytically to be diverging with time, while mean values and the Lyapunov function remained unchanged. Fluctuations in order parameters due to additive noises have been found to have the same time dependence as Brownian particles. Those due to multiplicative noises have shown deviations at larger times and for larger noise intensities. The time duration over which this metastable state could persist has been estimated for three types of noises. Noise effects associated with different nonlinearities were compared systematically and explicitly. \textcopyright{} 1992 The American Physical Society.}

  abstract = {My purpose in this paper is to sketch a research direction based on Francisco Varela's pioneering work in neurodynamics (see also Rudrauf et al. 2003, in this issue). Very early on he argued that the internal coherence of every mental-cognitive state lies in the global self-organization of the brain activities at the large-scale, constituting a fundamental pole of integration called here a "dynamic core". Recent neuroimaging evidence appears to broadly support this hypothesis and suggests that a global brain dynamics emerges at the large scale level from the cooperative interactions among widely distributed neuronal populations. Despite a growing body of evidence supporting this view, our understanding of these large-scale brain processes remains hampered by the lack of a theoretical language for expressing these complex behaviors in dynamical terms. In this paper, I propose a rough cartography of a comprehensive approach that offers a conceptual and mathematical framework to analyze spatio-temporal large-scale brain phenomena. I emphasize how these nonlinear methods can be applied, what property might be inferred from neuronal signals, and where one might productively proceed for the future. This paper is dedicated, with respect and affection, to the memory of Francisco Varela.},

  abstract = {Recent success in training deep neural networks have prompted active investigation into the features learned on their intermediate layers. Such research is difficult because it requires making sense of non-linear computations performed by millions of learned parameters, but valuable because it increases our ability to understand current models and training algorithms and thus create improved versions of them. In this paper we investigate the extent to which neural networks exhibit what we call convergent learning, which is when the representations learned by multiple nets converge to a set of features which are either individually similar between networks or where subsets of features span similar low-dimensional spaces. We propose a specific method of probing representations: training multiple networks and then comparing and contrasting their individual, learned representations at the level of neurons or groups of neurons. We begin research into this question using three techniques to approximately align different neural networks on a feature level: a bipartite matching approach that makes one-to-one assignments between neurons, a sparse prediction approach that finds one-to-many mappings, and a spectral clustering approach that finds many-to-many mappings. This initial investigation reveals a few previously unknown properties of neural networks, and we argue that future research into the question of convergent learning will yield many more. The insights described here include (1) that some features are learned reliably in multiple networks, yet other features are not consistently learned; (2) that units learn to span low-dimensional subspaces and, while these subspaces are common to multiple networks, the specific basis vectors learned are not; (3) that the representation codes are a mix between a local code and slightly, but not fully, distributed codes across multiple units.},

  abstract = {Despite the traditional focus of network science on static networks, most networked systems of scientific interest are characterized by temporal links. By disrupting the paths, link temporality has been shown to frustrate many dynamical processes on networks, from information spreading to accessibility. Considering the ubiquity of temporal networks in nature, we must ask: Are there any advantages of the networks' temporality? Here we develop an analytical framework to explore the control properties of temporal networks, arriving at the counterintuitive conclusion that temporal networks, compared to their static (i.e. aggregated) counterparts, reach controllability faster, demand orders of magnitude less control energy, and the control trajectories, through which the system reaches its final states, are significantly more compact than those characterizing their static counterparts. The combination of analytical, numerical and empirical results demonstrates that temporality ensures a degree of flexibility that would be unattainable in static networks, significantly enhancing our ability to control them.},

  abstract = {Social network theory is an important paradigm of social structure research, which has been widely used in various fields of research. This paper reviews the development process and the latest progress of social network theory research and analyzes the research application of social network. In order to reveal the deep social structure, this paper analyzes the structure of social networks from three levels: microlevel, mesolevel, and macrolevel and reveals the origin, development, perfection, and latest achievements of complex network models. The regular graph model, P1 model, P2 model, exponential random graph model, small-world network model, and scale-free network model are introduced. In the end, the research on the social network structure is reviewed, and social support network and social discussion network are introduced, which are two important contents of social network research. At present, the research on social networks has been widely used in coauthor networks, citation networks, mobile social networks, enterprise knowledge management, and individual happiness, but there are few research studies on multilevel structure, dynamic research, complex network research, whole network research, and discussion network research. This provides space for future research on social networks.},

  abstract = {Information flow or information transfer the widely applicable general physics notion can be rigorously derived from first principles, rather than axiomatically proposed as an ansatz. Its logical association with causality is firmly rooted in the dynamical system that lies beneath. The principle of nil causality that reads, an event is not causal to another if the evolution of the latter is independent of the former, which transfer entropy analysis and Granger causality test fail to verify in many situations, turns out to be a proven theorem here. Established in this study are the information flows among the components of time-discrete mappings and time-continuous dynamical systems, both deterministic and stochastic. They have been obtained explicitly in closed form, and put to applications with the benchmark systems such as the Kaplan-Yorke map, R\"ossler system, baker transformation, H\'enon map, and stochastic potential flow. Besides unraveling the causal relations as expected from the respective systems, some of the applications show that the information flow structure underlying a complex trajectory pattern could be tractable. For linear systems, the resulting remarkably concise formula asserts analytically that causation implies correlation, while correlation does not imply causation, providing a mathematical basis for the long-standing philosophical debate over causation versus correlation.},

  abstract = {We construct a stochastic SIR model for influenza spreading on a D-dimensional lattice, which represents the dynamic contact network of individuals. An age distributed population is placed on the lattice and moves on it. The displacement from a site to a nearest neighbor empty site, allows individuals to change the number and identities of their contacts. The dynamics on the lattice is governed by an attractive interaction between individuals belonging to the same age-class. The parameters, which regulate the pattern dynamics, are fixed fitting the data on the age-dependent daily contact numbers, furnished by the Polymod survey. A simple SIR transmission model with a nearest neighbors interaction and some very basic adaptive mobility restrictions complete the model. The model is validated against the age-distributed Italian epidemiological data for the influenza A(H1N1) during the 2009/2010 season, with sensible predictions for the epidemiological parameters. For an appropriate topology of the lattice, we find that, whenever the accordance between the contact patterns of the model and the Polymod data is satisfactory, there is a good agreement between the numerical and the experimental epidemiological data. This result shows how rich is the information encoded in the average contact patterns of individuals, with respect to the analysis of the epidemic spreading of an infectious disease. \textcopyright{} 2013 Liccardo, Fierro.}

  abstract = {Neuronal responses of sensory cortex are highly variable, and this variability is correlated across neurons. To assess how variability reflects factors shared across a neuronal population, we analyzed the activity of many simultaneously recorded neurons in visual cortex. We developed a simple model that comprises two sources of shared variability: a multiplicative gain, which uniformly scales each neuron's sensory drive, and an additive offset, which affects different neurons to different degrees. This model captured the variability of spike counts and reproduced the dependence of pairwise correlations on neuronal tuning and stimulus orientation. The relative contributions of the additive and multiplicative fluctuations could vary over time and had marked impact on population coding. These observations indicate that shared variability of neuronal populations in sensory cortex can be largely explained by two factors that modulate the whole population.},

In the healthy children, the ERP evoked by the Stop Signal differed for successful inhibitions (SI) compared to failed inhibitions (FI), with greater amplitude of a positive wave peaking around 320 msec over anterior medial frontal scalp (P3a). Such success-related P3a activity was significantly reduced in amplitude in the ADHD group. In addition, the error related negativity (ERN), a sharp negative wave that is present selectively on error trials in choice RT experiments, peaking 100 ms after motor onset, and distributed over anterior medial frontal scalp, was also markedly reduced in the ADHD group. The scalp distribution of the group differences in P3a and the ERN is consistent with a reduction of activity of sources in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), suggesting a global deficit in cognitive control operations subserved by dACC in ADHD.},

However, the biophysical mechanisms that modulate these correlations are poorly understood. With a combined theoretical and experimental approach, we show that the rate of balanced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input modulates the magnitude and timescale of pairwise spike train correlation. High rate synaptic inputs promote spike time synchrony rather than long timescale spike rate correlations, while low rate synaptic inputs produce opposite results. This correlation shaping is due to a combination of enhanced high frequency input transfer and reduced firing rate gain in the high input rate state compared to the low state. Our study extends neural modulation from single neuron responses to population activity, a necessary step in understanding how the dynamics and processing of neural activity change across distinct brain states.},

We studied the effect of clustered excitatory connections on the dynamics of neuronal networks that exhibited high spike time variability owing to a balance between excitation and inhibition. Even modest clustering substantially changed the behavior of these networks, introducing slow dynamics during which clusters of neurons transiently increased or decreased their firing rate. Consequently, neurons exhibited both fast spiking variability and slow firing rate fluctuations. A simplified model shows how stimuli bias networks toward particular activity states, thereby reducing firing rate variability as observed experimentally in many cortical areas. Our model thus relates cortical architecture to the reported variability in spontaneous and evoked spiking activity.},

  abstract = {The ultimate proof of our understanding of natural or technological systems is reflected in our ability to control them. Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.},

  abstract = {A reflection of our ultimate understanding of a complex system is our ability to control its behavior. Typically, control has multiple prerequisites: It requires an accurate map of the network that governs the interactions between the system's components, a quantitative description of the dynamical laws that govern the temporal behavior of each component, and an ability to influence the state and temporal behavior of a selected subset of the components. With deep roots in nonlinear dynamics and control theory, notions of control and controllability have taken a new life recently in the study of complex networks, inspiring several fundamental questions: What are the control principles of complex systems? How do networks organize themselves to balance control with functionality? To address these here we review recent advances on the controllability and the control of complex networks, exploring the intricate interplay between a system's structure, captured by its network topology, and the dynamical laws that govern the interactions between the components. We match the pertinent mathematical results with empirical findings and applications. We show that uncovering the control principles of complex systems can help us explore and ultimately understand the fundamental laws that govern their behavior.},

  abstract = {Many systems on our planet are known to shift abruptly and irreversibly from one state to another when they are forced across a "tipping point," such as mass extinctions in ecological networks, cascading failures in infrastructure systems, and social convention changes in human and animal networks. Such a regime shift demonstrates a system's resilience that characterizes the ability of a system to adjust its activity to retain its basic functionality in the face of internal disturbances or external environmental changes. In the past 50 years, attention was almost exclusively given to low dimensional systems and calibration of their resilience functions and indicators of early warning signals without considerations for the interactions between the components. Only in recent years, taking advantages of the network theory and lavish real data sets, network scientists have directed their interest to the real-world complex networked multidimensional systems and their resilience function and early warning indicators. This report is devoted to a comprehensive review of resilience function and regime shift of complex systems in different domains, such as ecology, biology, social systems and infrastructure. We cover the related research about empirical observations, experimental studies, mathematical modeling, and theoretical analysis. We also discuss some ambiguous definitions, such as robustness, resilience, and stability.},

Information modification remains poorly described however, with the popularly-understood examples of glider and particle collisions in cellular automata being only quantitatively identified to date using a heuristic (separable information) rather than a proper information-theoretic measure. We outline how a recently-introduced axiomatic framework for measuring information redundancy and synergy, called partial information decomposition, can be applied to a perspective of distributed computation in order to quantify component operations on information. Using this framework, we propose a new measure of information modification that captures the intuitive understanding of information modification events as those involving interactions between two or more information sources. We also consider how the local dynamics of information modification in space and time could be measured, and suggest a new axiom that redundancy measures would need to meet in order to make such local measurements. Finally, we evaluate the potential for existing redundancy measures to meet this localizability axiom.},

In this Special Issue on ``Information Decomposition of Target Effects from Multi-Source Interactions'' at Entropy, we have gathered current work on such information decomposition approaches from many of the leading research groups in the field.

We then introduce the articles included in the special issue one by one, providing a similar categorisation of these articles into: i. proposals of new measures; ii. theoretical investigations into properties and interpretations of such approaches, and iii. applications of these measures in empirical studies.

In some of these cells the ionic conductances responsible for their excitability also endow them with autorhythmic electrical oscillatory properties. Chemical or electrical synaptic contacts between these neurons often result in network oscillations. In such networks, autorhythmic neurons may act as true oscillators (as pacemakers) or as resonators (responding preferentially to certain firing frequencies). Oscillations and resonance in the CNS are proposed to have diverse functional roles, such as (i) determining global functional states (for example, sleep-wakefulness or attention), (ii) timing in motor coordination, and (iii) specifying connectivity during development. Also, oscillation, especially in the thalamo-cortical circuits, may be related to certain neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review proposes that the autorhythmic electrical properties of central neurons and their connectivity form the basis for an intrinsic functional coordinate system that provides internal context to sensory input.},

  abstract = {A simple model consisting of two diffusively coupled logistic maps is used to examine the effects of spatial heterogeneity on population dynamics. Examining the dynamic behaviour of the model using numerical methods, a wide range of behaviours are observed. It is shown that the coupling can stabilize individually chaotic populations, and that under different circumstances the coupling can cause individually stable periodic populations to undergo more complex behaviour. The system exhibits multiple attractors when the qualitative dynamics of the system depend on the initial conditions. Sudden changes in the structure of the attractors are seen for small changes in the parameters; these changes are known as crises. Transient and intermittent behaviours are observed. The implications of all these behaviours for populations are discussed. A linear coupling of the two maps is also considered which leads to counterintuitive behaviour, with chaotic dynamics being obtained by coupling two stable maps. This behaviour occurs because the coupling involves mixing of generations, and is therefore biologically unrealistic. \textcopyright{} 1995 Academic Press Limited.}

Here, we report the direct observation of gamma oscillations as spatiotemporal waves induced by targeted optogenetic stimulation, recorded by intracortical multichannel extracellular techniques in macaque monkeys during their awake, resting states. Microelectrode arrays integrating an optical fiber at their center were chronically implanted in primary motor (M1) and ventral premotor (PMv) cortices of two subjects. Targeted brain tissue was transduced with the red-shifted opsin C1V1(T/T). Constant (1-s square pulses) and ramp stimulation induced narrowband gamma oscillations during awake resting states. Recordings across 95 microelectrodes (4 X 4 mm array) enabled us to track the transient gamma spatiotemporal patterns manifested e.g. as concentric expanding and spiral waves. Gamma oscillations were induced well beyond the light stimulation volume, via network interactions at distal electrode sites, depending on optical power. Despite stimulation-related modulation in spiking rates, neuronal spiking remained highly asynchronous during induced gamma oscillations. In one subject we examined stimulation effects during preparation and execution of a motor task and observed that movement execution largely attenuated optically-induced gamma oscillations. Our findings demonstrate that, beyond previously reported induced gamma activity under periodic drive, a prolonged constant-stimulus above a certain threshold may carry primate motor cortex network dynamics into gamma oscillations, likely via a Hopf bifurcation. More broadly, the experimental capability in combining microelectrode array recordings and optogenetic stimulation provides an important approach for probing spatiotemporal dynamics in primate cortical networks during various physiological and behavioral conditions.},

  abstract = {Complex systems abound in public health. Complex systems are made up of heterogeneous elements that interact with one another, have emergent properties that are not explained by understanding the individual elements of the system, persist over time, and adapt to changing circumstances. Public health is starting to use results from systems science studies to shape practice and policy, for example in preparing for global pandemics. However, systems science study designs and analytic methods remain underutilized and are not widely featured in public health curricula or training. In this review we present an argument for the utility of systems science methods in public health, introduce three important systems science methods (system dynamics, network analysis, and agent-based modeling), and provide three case studies in which these methods have been used to answer important public health science questions in the areas of infectious disease, tobacco control, and obesity.},

The crux of the method is to either accept or reject together both of the offsprings from reversible crossing-over operations. This method can converge faster than traditional MCMC methods in several problems; numerical computations for two model distributions are shown. The relationship between the presented method, Swendsen-Wang -type algorithms, and Metropolis-Coupled MCMC is discussed. \textcopyright{} 2002 VSP.}

To address this, we used calcium imaging of mouse thalamocortical slices to reconstruct, with single-cell resolution, the spatiotemporal dynamics of activity of layer 4 in the presence or absence of thalamic stimulation. We found spontaneous neuronal coactivations corresponded to intracellular UP states. Thalamic stimulation of sufficient frequency ({$>$}10 Hz) triggered cortical activity, and UP states, indistinguishable from those arising spontaneously. Moreover, neurons were activated in identical and precise spatiotemporal patterns in thalamically triggered and spontaneous events. The similarities between cortical activations indicate that intracortical connectivity plays the dominant role in the cortical response to thalamic inputs. Our data demonstrate that precise spatiotemporal activity patterns can be triggered by thalamic inputs and indicate that the thalamus serves to release intrinsic cortical dynamics.},

  abstract = {Counterdrug interdiction efforts designed to seize or disrupt cocaine shipments between South American source zones and US markets remain a core US ``supply side'' drug policy and national security strategy. However, despite a long history of US-led interdiction efforts in the Western Hemisphere, cocaine movements to the United States through Central America, or ``narco-trafficking,'' continue to rise. Here, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model (ABM), called ``NarcoLogic,'' of narco-trafficker operational decision making in response to interdiction forces to investigate the root causes of interdiction ineffectiveness across space and time. The central premise tested was that spatial proliferation and resiliency of narco-trafficking are not a consequence of ineffective interdiction, but rather part and natural consequence of interdiction itself. Model development relied on multiple theoretical perspectives, empirical studies, media reports, and the authors' own years of field research in the region. Parameterization and validation used the best available, authoritative data source for illicit cocaine flows. Despite inherently biased, unreliable, and/or incomplete data of a clandestine phenomenon, the model compellingly reproduced the ``cat-and-mouse'' dynamic between narco-traffickers and interdiction forces others have qualitatively described. The model produced qualitatively accurate and quantitatively realistic spatial and temporal patterns of cocaine trafficking in response to interdiction events. The NarcoLogic model offers a much-needed, evidence-based tool for the robust assessment of different drug policy scenarios, and their likely impact on trafficker behavior and the many collateral damages associated with the militarized war on drugs.},

The posterior hippocampi of taxi drivers were significantly larger relative to those of control subjects. A more anterior hippocampal region was larger in control subjects than in taxi drivers. Hippocampal volume correlated with the amount of time spent as a taxi driver (positively in the posterior and negatively in the anterior hippocampus). These data are in accordance with the idea that the posterior hippocampus stores a spatial representation of the environment and can expand regionally to accommodate elaboration of this representation in people with a high dependence on navigational skills. It seems that there is a capacity for local plastic change in the structure of the healthy adult human brain in response to environmental demands.},

Nonparametric statistical tests offer complete freedom to the user with respect to the test statistic by means of which the experimental conditions are compared. This freedom provides a straightforward way to solve the multiple comparisons problem (MCP) and it allows to incorporate biophysically motivated constraints in the test statistic, which may drastically increase the sensitivity of the statistical test. The paper is written for two audiences: (1) empirical neuroscientists looking for the most appropriate data analysis method, and (2) methodologists interested in the theoretical concepts behind nonparametric statistical tests. For the empirical neuroscientist, a large part of the paper is written in a tutorial-like fashion, enabling neuroscientists to construct their own statistical test, maximizing the sensitivity to the expected effect. And for the methodologist, it is explained why the nonparametric test is formally correct. This means that we formulate a null hypothesis (identical probability distribution in the different experimental conditions) and show that the nonparametric test controls the false alarm rate under this null hypothesis. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) is the most widely used AAV vector in clinical trials based largely on its ability to transduce neural cells in the rodent and primate brain. Prior work in rodents suggests that other serotypes might be more efficient; however, a systematic evaluation of vector transduction efficiency has not yet been performed in the primate brain. In this study, AAV viral vectors of serotypes 1\textendash 6 with an enhanced green-fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene were generated at comparable titers, and injected in equal amounts into the brains of Chlorocebus sabaeus. Vector injections were placed in the substantia nigra (SN) and the caudate nucleus (CD). One month after injection, immunohistochemistry for GFP was performed and the total number of GFP + cells was calculated using unbiased stereology. AAV5 was the most efficient vector, not only transducing significantly more cells than any other serotype, but also transducing both NeuN + and glial-fibrillary-acidic protein positive (GFAP +) cells. These results suggest that AAV5 is a more effective vector than AAV2 at delivering potentially therapeutic transgenes to the nigrostriatal system of the primate brain.},

  abstract = {We present a first-draft digital reconstruction of the microcircuitry of somatosensory cortex of juvenile rat. The reconstruction uses cellular and synaptic organizing principles to algorithmically reconstruct detailed anatomy and physiology from sparse experimental data. An objective anatomical method defines a neocortical volume of 0.29 {$\pm$} 0.01 mm3 containing {$\sim$}31,000 neurons, and patch-clamp studies identify 55 layer-specific morphological and 207 morpho-electrical neuron subtypes. When digitally reconstructed neurons are positioned in the volume and synapse formation is restricted to biological bouton densities and numbers of synapses per connection, their overlapping arbors form {$\sim$}8 million connections with {$\sim$}37 million synapses. Simulations reproduce an array of in vitro and in vivo experiments without parameter tuning. Additionally, we find a spectrum of network states with a sharp transition from synchronous to asynchronous activity, modulated by physiological mechanisms. The spectrum of network states, dynamically reconfigured around this transition, supports diverse information processing strategies. PaperClip Video Abstract},

The isolation reared rat attempts to model adverse effects that human social isolation (absence of social contact) can have on normal brain development. The isolation reared rat also models aspects of schizophrenia including the development of persistent learning and memory deficits. This short review concentrates on the effects of isolation rearing on cognition, including deficits in novel object discrimination, and the neural mechanisms that may underlie this impairment. There is evidence that a key effect of social isolation may be loss of neuronal plasticity combined with change in the functional state of various cortical and hippocampal neurotransmitters, including glutamate and serotonin. Reduced glutamate function may underlie the deficits in novel object discrimination, which can be reversed by administration of a 5-HT(6) receptor antagonist. This suggests that the 5-HT(6) antagonists may act by reducing 5-HT(6) receptor mediated activation of GABA, resulting in glutamate disinhibition. Thus drugs acting at 5-HT(6) receptors may offer a novel approach to treat neurodevelopmental cognitive symptoms, including those seen in schizophrenia.},

This function of sleep has been linked to slow ({$<$}1 Hz) potential oscillations, which predominantly arise from the prefrontal neocortex and characterize slow wave sleep. However, oscillations in brain potentials are commonly considered to be mere epiphenomena that reflect synchronized activity arising from neuronal networks, which links the membrane and synaptic processes of these neurons in time. Whether brain potentials and their extracellular equivalent have any physiological meaning per se is unclear, but can easily be investigated by inducing the extracellular oscillating potential fields of interest. Here we show that inducing slow oscillation-like potential fields by transcranial application of oscillating potentials (0.75 Hz) during early nocturnal non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, that is, a period of emerging slow wave sleep, enhances the retention of hippocampus-dependent declarative memories in healthy humans. The slowly oscillating potential stimulation induced an immediate increase in slow wave sleep, endogenous cortical slow oscillations and slow spindle activity in the frontal cortex. Brain stimulation with oscillations at 5 Hz--another frequency band that normally predominates during rapid-eye-movement sleep--decreased slow oscillations and left declarative memory unchanged. Our findings indicate that endogenous slow potential oscillations have a causal role in the sleep-associated consolidation of memory, and that this role is enhanced by field effects in cortical extracellular space.},

In such models, the covariance between observables (e.g., symptoms like depressed mood, feelings of worthlessness, and guilt) is explained in terms of a pattern of causal interactions between these observables, which contrasts with classical interpretations in which the observables are conceptualized as the effects of a reflective latent variable. However, few investigations have been directed at the question how these different models relate to each other. To shed light on this issue, the current paper explores the relation between one of the most important network models -the Ising model from physics-and one of the most important latent variable models -the Item Response Theory (IRT) model from psychometrics. The Ising model describes the interac-tion between states of particles that are connected in a network, whereas the IRT model describes the probability distribution associated with item responses in a psychometric test as a function of a latent variable. Despite the divergent backgrounds of the models, we show a broad equivalence between them and also illustrate several opportunities that arise from this connection.},

Among these, direct reciprocity supports cooperation on the basis of repeated interactions among individuals. Signals and quorum dynamics may also drive cooperation. Here, we resort to an evolutionary game-theoretical model to jointly analyse these two mechanisms and study the conditions in which evolution selects for direct reciprocity, signalling, or their combination. We show that signalling alone leads to higher levels of cooperation than when combined with reciprocity, while offering additional robustness against errors. Specifically, successful strategies in the realm of direct reciprocity are often not selected in the presence of signalling, and memory of past interactions is only exploited opportunistically in the case of earlier coordination failure. Differently, signalling always evolves, even when costly. In the light of these results, it may be easier to understand why direct reciprocity has been observed only in a limited number of cases among non-humans, whereas signalling is widespread at all levels of complexity.},

Many depolarizing and hyperpolarizing tools have now been developed in multiple laboratories and tested across different preparations, presenting opportunities but also making it difficult to draw direct comparisons. This challenge has been compounded by the dependence of performance on parameters such as vector, promoter, expression time, illumination, cell type and many other variables. As a result, it has become increasingly complicated for end users to select the optimal reagents for their experimental needs. For a rapidly growing field, critical figures of merit should be formalized both to establish a framework for further development and so that end users can readily understand how these standardized parameters translate into performance. Here we systematically compared microbial opsins under matched experimental conditions to extract essential principles and identify key parameters for the conduct, design and interpretation of experiments involving optogenetic techniques.},

We studied a PN population, stimulated with five odorants and pulse durations between 0.3 and 10 s. Odor representations were characterized as time series of vectors of PN activity, constructed from the firing rates of all PNs in successive 50 ms time bins. Odor representations by the PN population can be described as trajectories in PN state space with three main phases: an on transient, lasting 1-2 s; a fixed point, stable for at least 8 s; and an off transient, lasting a few seconds as activity returns to baseline. Whereas all three phases are odor specific, optimal stimulus separation occurred during the transients rather than the fixed points. In addition, the PNs' own target neurons respond least when their PN-population input stabilized at a fixed point.

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {Stochastic resonance is said to be observed when increases in levels of unpredictable fluctuations\textemdash e.g., random noise\textemdash cause an increase in a metric of the quality of signal transmission or detection performance, rather than a decrease. This counterintuitive effect relies on system nonlinearities and on some parameter ranges being ``suboptimal''. Stochastic resonance has been observed, quantified, and described in a plethora of physical and biological systems, including neurons. Being a topic of widespread multidisciplinary interest, the definition of stochastic resonance has evolved significantly over the last decade or so, leading to a number of debates, misunderstandings, and controversies. Perhaps the most important debate is whether the brain has evolved to utilize random noise in vivo, as part of the ``neural code''. Surprisingly, this debate has been for the most part ignored by neuroscientists, despite much indirect evidence of a positive role for noise in the brain. We explore some of the reasons for this and argue why it would be more surprising if the brain did not exploit randomness provided by noise\textemdash via stochastic resonance or otherwise\textemdash than if it did. We also challenge neuroscientists and biologists, both computational and experimental, to embrace a very broad definition of stochastic resonance in terms of signal-processing ``noise benefits'', and to devise experiments aimed at verifying that random variability can play a functional role in the brain, nervous system, or other areas of biology.},

The validity of the assumptions of ICA, mainly that the underlying components are spatially independent and add linearly, was explored with a representative fMRI data set by calculating the log-likelihood of observing each voxel's time course conditioned on the ICA model. The probability of observing the time courses from white-matter voxels was higher compared to other observed brain regions. Regions containing blood vessels had the lowest probabilities. The statistical distribution of probabilities over all voxels did not resemble that expected for a small number of independent components mixed with Gaussian noise. These results suggest the ICA model may more accurately represent the data in specific regions of the brain, and that both the activity-dependent sources of blood flow and noise are non-Gaussian.},

Yet a radically different approach to conceptualizing psychopathology promises to advance our understanding, thereby complementing traditional laboratory experiments. In contrast to viewing symptoms as reflective of underlying, latent categories or dimensions, network analysis conceptualizes symptoms as constitutive of mental disorders, not reflective of them. Disorders emerge from the causal interactions among symptoms themselves, and intervening on central symptoms in disorder networks promises to foster rapid recovery. One purpose of this article is to contrast network analysis with traditional approaches, and consider its strengths and limitations. A second purpose is to review novel computational methods that may enable researchers to discern the causal structure of disorders (e.g., Bayesian networks).

  abstract = {Frequently disrupted and restricted sleep is a common problem for many people in our modern around-the-clock society. In this context, it is an important question how sleep loss affects the stress systems in our bodies since these systems enable us to deal with everyday challenges. Altered activity and reactivity of these systems following insufficient sleep might have serious repercussions for health and well-being. Studies on both humans and rodents have shown that sleep deprivation and sleep restriction are conditions often associated with mild, temporary increases in the activity of the major neuroendocrine stress systems, i.e., the autonomic sympatho-adrenal system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Sleep deprivation may not only have a direct activating effect by itself but, in the long run, it may also affect the reactivity of these systems to other stressors and challenges. Although the first signs of alterations in the way people deal with challenges under conditions of restricted sleep appear to be on the level of emotional perception, chronic sleep restriction may ultimately change the fundamental properties of neuroendocrine stress systems as well. Understandably, few controlled studies in humans have been devoted to this topic. Yet, experimental studies in rodents show that chronic sleep restriction may gradually alter neuroendocrine stress responses as well as the central mechanisms involved in the regulation of these responses. Importantly, the available data from studies in laboratory animals suggest that sleep restriction may gradually change certain brain systems and neuroendocrine systems in a manner that is similar to what is seen in stress-related disorders such as depression (e.g., reduced serotonin receptor sensitivity and altered regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis). Such data support the view that insufficient sleep, by acting on stress systems, may sensitize individuals to stress-related disorders. Indeed, epidemiological studies suggest that sleep complaints and sleep restriction may be important risk factors for a variety of diseases that are often linked to stress, including cardiovascular diseases and mood disorders.},

However, manually outlining those lesions constitutes a difficult and time-consuming process that renders detailedly annotated data difficult to obtain. In this paper, we investigate an alternative approach, namely multiple-instance learning (MIL), that does not require detailed information for optimization. We have applied MIL to a CAD system for tuberculosis detection. Only the case condition (normal or abnormal) was required during training. Based upon the well-known miSVM technique, we propose an improved algorithm that overcomes miSVM's drawbacks related to positive instance underestimation and costly iteration. To show the advantages of our MIL-based approach as compared with a traditional supervised one, experiments with three X-ray databases were conducted. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was utilized as a performance measure. With the first database, for which training lesion annotations were available, our MIL-based method was comparable to the supervised system ( 0.86 versus 0.88 ). When evaluating the remaining databases, given their large difference with the previous image set, the most appealing strategy was to retrain the CAD systems. However, since only the case condition was available, only the MIL-based system could be retrained. This scenario, which is common in real-world applications, demonstrates the better adaptation capabilities of the proposed approach. After retraining, our MIL-based system significantly outperformed the supervised one ( 0.86 versus 0.79 and 0.91 versus 0.85 , and p=0.0002 , respectively).},

Among many application domains, the analysis of large trajectory datasets generated from people's movements at the city scale is one of the most promising research avenues still to explore. Extracting trajectory patterns and outliers in urban environments is a direction still requiring exploration for many management and planning tasks. The research developed in this paper introduces a spatio-temporal framework, so-called STE-SD (Spatio-Temporal Entropy for Similarity Detection), based on the initial concept of entropy as introduced by Shannon in his seminal theory of information and as recently extended to the spatial and temporal dimensions. Our approach considers several complementary trajectory descriptors whose distribution in space and time are quantitatively evaluated. The trajectory primitives considered include curvatures, stop-points, self-intersections and velocities. These primitives are identified and then qualified using the notion of entropy as applied to the spatial and temporal dimensions. The whole approach is experimented and applied to urban trajectories derived from the Geolife dataset, a reference data benchmark available in the city of Beijing.},

  abstract = {The complex connectivity of the cerebral cortex suggests that inter-regional communication is a primary function. Using computational modeling, we show that anatomical connectivity may be a major determinant for global information flow in brain networks. A macaque brain network was implemented as a communication network in which signal units flowed between grey matter nodes along white matter paths. Compared to degree-matched surrogate networks, information flow on the macaque brain network was characterized by higher loss rates, faster transit times and lower throughput, suggesting that neural connectivity may be optimized for speed rather than fidelity. Much of global communication was mediated by a "rich club" of hub regions: a sub-graph comprised of high-degree nodes that are more densely interconnected with each other than predicted by chance. First, macaque communication patterns most closely resembled those observed for a synthetic rich club network, but were less similar to those seen in a synthetic small world network, suggesting that the former is a more fundamental feature of brain network topology. Second, rich club regions attracted the most signal traffic and likewise, connections between rich club regions carried more traffic than connections between non-rich club regions. Third, a number of rich club regions were significantly under-congested, suggesting that macaque connectivity actively shapes information flow, funneling traffic towards some nodes and away from others. Together, our results indicate a critical role of the rich club of hub nodes in dynamic aspects of global brain communication.},

  abstract = {We present results from an experiment similar to one performed by Packard (1988), in which a genetic algorithm is used to evolve cellular automata (CA) to perform a particular computational task. Packard examined the frequency of evolved CA rules as a function of Langton's lambda parameter (Langton, 1990), and interpreted the results of his experiment as giving evidence for the following two hypotheses: (1) CA rules able to perform complex computations are most likely to be found near ``critical'' lambda values, which have been claimed to correlate with a phase transition between ordered and chaotic behavioral regimes for CA; (2) When CA rules are evolved to perform a complex computation, evolution will tend to select rules with lambda values close to the critical values. Our experiment produced very different results, and we suggest that the interpretation of the original results is not correct. We also review and discuss issues related to lambda, dynamical-behavior classes, and computation in CA. The main constructive results of our study are identifying the emergence and competition of computational strategies and analyzing the central role of symmetries in an evolutionary system. In particular, we demonstrate how symmetry breaking can impede the evolution toward higher computational capability.},

Polymorphisms of the 5-HT6 receptor have been implicated in syndromes that affect cognition, such as schizophrenia and dementia. Manipulation of 5-HT6 receptor activity alters the transmission of several neurotransmitters important in memory: acetylcholine and glutamate, as well as dopamine, \~a-aminobutyric acid (GABA), epinephrine (E), and norepinephrine (NE). Several 5-HT6 antagonists have been developed, advancing the understanding of the relationship between 5-HT6 blockade and memory consolidation in diverse learning paradigms. There is also evidence that 5-HT6 receptor activity affects anxiety behaviors and may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Several clinically useful atypical antipsychotics and antidepressants have 5-HT6 affinity, but recently developed selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonists may present attractive, new therapeutic options for several types of disease states.},

Similar clustering patterns are observed by seismologists, as earthquakes are well known to increase the risk of subsequent earthquakes, or aftershocks, near the location of an initial event. Space-time clustering is modeled in seismology by selfexciting point processes and the focus of this article is to show that these methods are well suited for criminological applications. We first review self-exciting point processes in the context of seismology. Next, using residential burglary data provided by the Los Angeles Police Department, we illustrate the implementation of self-exciting point process models in the context of urban crime. For this purpose we use a fully nonparametric estimation methodology to gain insight into the form of the space-time triggering function and temporal trends in the background rate of burglary. \textcopyright{} 2011 American Statistical Association.},

In statistical mechanics they provided a key insight into a 60-y-old fundamental problem of the subject\textemdash namely, the rationale for the hypothesis that time averages can be set equal to phase averages. The evolution of this problem is traced from the origins of statistical mechanics and Boltzman's ergodic hypothesis to the Ehrenfests' quasi-ergodic hypothesis, and then to the ergodic theorems. We discuss communications between von Neumann and Birkhoff in the Fall of 1931 leading up to the publication of these papers and related issues of priority. These ergodic theorems initiated a new field of mathematical-research called ergodic theory that has thrived ever since, and we discuss some of recent developments in ergodic theory that are relevant for statistical mechanics.},

Although all these models share common elements, like discrete networks and boolean variables, and more important the existence of an Ising-like transition; there is also an important difference given by their particular evolution rules. As a result, the above implies the fact that macroscopic variables like energy and magnetization will show a dependence on the particular model chosen. To summarize, we will discuss and compare the time dynamics for these variables, exploring whether they are conserved, strictly decreasing (or increasing) or fluctuating around a macroscopic equilibrium regime.},

The computational complexity of CI is O(N log N) when removing nodes one-by-one, made possible through an appropriate data structure to process CI. We introduce two Belief-Propagation (BP) variants of CI that consider global optimization via message-passing: CI propagation (CIP) and Collective-Immunization-Belief-Propagation algorithm (CIBP) based on optimal immunization. Both identify a slightly smaller fraction of influencers than CI and, remarkably, reproduce the exact analytical optimal percolation threshold obtained in Random Struct. Alg. 21, 397 (2002) for cubic random regular graphs, leaving little room for improvement for random graphs. However, the small augmented performance comes at the expense of increasing running time to O(N2), rendering BP prohibitive for modern-day big-data. For instance, for big-data social networks of 200 million users (e.g., Twitter users sending 500 million tweets/day), CI finds influencers in 2.5 hours on a single CPU, while all BP algorithms (CIP, CIBP and BDP) would take more than 3,000 years to accomplish the same task.},

Our findings highlight the utility of "homozygosity mapping" in heterogeneous disorders like autism but also suggest that defective regulation of gene expression after neural activity may be a mechanism common to seemingly diverse autism mutations.},

Which side of the trade-off is prioritized depends on the objective that is pursued by the criminal group. The distinction is most salient when comparing terrorist with criminal enterprise networks. Terrorist networks are ideologically driven, while criminal enterprises pursue monetary ends. Time-to-task is shorter in the criminal enterprise and group efficiency is therefore prioritized over group security. Terrorist networks, in contrast, have longer horizons and security is prioritized over the execution of any single attack. Using Krebs' exploratory research on networks of terrorist cells and electronic surveillance transcripts of a drug importation network, our analyses demonstrate how these opposing trade-offs emerge in criminal group structures.},

Like most people, they all operate in social networks\textemdash and at times, they come together in criminal networks which, though tightly structured and controlled, undergo constant change. Inside Criminal Networks takes a social network perspective to a variety of illegal enterprises, focusing on these organizations' "flexible order" and the collective coping and adjustment strategies of offenders when key members or opportunities are lost. Rich with communication data, electronic surveillance material, and other law-enforcement investigative sources, case studies pursue a number of analytical paths into the partnerships, pecking orders, and situations in flux (e.g., street gang presence within drug distribution), and identify central challenges to research (e.g., are these failed networks if members are arrested?). Flexibility is revealed as a driving force as the book examines: * Operational structures and dynamics. * Roles of key and peripheral players. * The tentative balance between efficiency and security. * Criminal network positions and individual traits. * Uses of legitimate actors in illegal settings. * Adaptation when networks are disrupted. Compellingly written and meticulously presented, Inside Criminal Networks offers rare up-close insights to readers in the criminology and organized crime research fields, and to social network theorists and analysts.},

The aim is to distinguish between participants who were positioned vulnerably and/or strategically during a period when the network was targeted by an intensive law-enforcement investigation. Two centrality measures are used throughout the analysis. Degree centrality accounts for the number of direct contacts surrounding a participant. Betweenness centrality accounts for a participant's brokerage leverage by measuring the scope of indirect relationships that s/he mediates. The final results reveal how differential positions in the network influence the judicial outcomes (arrests) within the case. Participants with high degree centrality were more likely to be arrested. Participants with high betweenness centrality were less likely to be arrested. Most importantly for law-enforcement concerns, those participants with high brokerage level were less likely to be members of the Hells Angels, thus suggesting that targeting strategies must take consider the patterns that represent an offender's network at any given time, rather than simply focusing on an offender's status and reputation within a criminal organization. \textcopyright{} 2010 SAGE Publications.},

In addition, anatomical magnetic resonance images were collected for all patients and a subsample of the controls (n=21) after task completion. Behaviourally, no significant differences were found between both groups. However, in the MRI analyses, grey matter volume (GMV) was correlated with performance using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Group differences in correlations of performance with GMV were apparent in medial regions of the prefrontal cortex as well as the middle occipital gyrus and the cuneus. By comparison, similar correlations for both groups were found in the inferior parietal lobule. These data provide novel insight into the relation between testosterone and brain development and suggest that morphological differences in a spatial navigation network covary with performance in spatial ability.},

Past research has used this method to analyze exposure to content on social media and the web. However, we still lack a systematic assessment of how different choices in the construction of these networks impact the results. Here we evaluate three different filtering rules that have been used in the literature to eliminate noise in raw data and identify the strongest connections (i.e., those above a certain weight). Moreover, we also provide a mathematical heuristic to choose the optimal threshold. To illustrate our approach, we use two observed networks measuring co-exposure to news sources on the web. We then formulate the problem of filtering the networks as a trade-off between network sparsity (i.e., the need to remove the weakest ties) and connectedness (i.e., the need to preserve the observed connectivity). Our mathematical approach resolves this problem by finding the threshold that maximizes the number of edges removed while minimizing the number of nodes becoming isolates. This analytical technique is generalizable and can be applied to the analysis of any weighted structure that requires solving a similar trade-off between network measures.},

Despite the growing interest in brain stimulation as a form of neuromodulation, much remains unknown about the network-level impact of these focal perturbations. To study the system wide impact of regional stimulation, we employ a data-driven computational model of nonlinear brain dynamics to systematically explore the effects of targeted stimulation. Validating predictions from network control theory, we uncover the relationship between regional controllability and the focal versus global impact of stimulation, and we relate these findings to differences in the underlying network architecture. Finally, by mapping brain regions to cognitive systems, we observe that the default mode system imparts large global change despite being highly constrained by structural connectivity. This work forms an important step towards the development of personalized stimulation protocols for medical treatment or performance enhancement.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Results from transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies of visual cortex have confirmed visual cortical hyperexcitability in patients with migraine. It has been speculated that this may be due to deficient intracortical inhibitory tone. However, the TMS induction of phosphenes relies on the reporting of a subjective experience, and may thus be subject to bias. METHODS: Seven migraineurs with visual aura and seven sex- and age-matched controls were studied. Fifty-four different three-letter combinations were briefly displayed and followed by a magnetic pulse at 40, 70, 100, 130, 160, and 190 msec. Subjects were required to report as many letters as they thought they had recognized. RESULTS: In the migraine group, the mean proportion of correctly identified letters was significantly higher at 100 msec, as was the proportion of trials with two or three letters correctly reported. The time window in which perceptual suppression could be introduced was narrower in migraineurs compared to controls. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that inhibitory systems are activated to a lesser extent by TMS pulses in patients. This observation is in agreement with the hypothesized deficiency of intracortical inhibition of the visual cortex, at least in migraineurs with aura.},

  abstract = {A celebrated and controversial hypothesis suggests that some biological systems-parts, aspects, or groups of them-may extract important functional benefits from operating at the edge of instability, halfway between order and disorder, i.e., in the vicinity of the critical point of a phase transition. Criticality has been argued to provide biological systems with an optimal balance between robustness against perturbations and flexibility to adapt to changing conditions as well as to confer on them optimal computational capabilities, large dynamical repertoires, unparalleled sensitivity to stimuli, etc. Criticality, with its concomitant scale invariance, can be conjectured to emerge in living systems as the result of adaptive and evolutionary processes that, for reasons to be fully elucidated, select for it as a template upon which further layers of complexity can rest. This hypothesis is suggestive as it proposes that criticality could constitute a general and common organizing strategy in biology stemming from the physics of phase transitions. However, despite its implications, this is still in its infancy state as a well-founded theory and, as such, it has elicited some skepticism. From the experimental side, the advent of high-Throughput technologies has created new prospects in the exploration of biological systems, and empirical evidence in favor of criticality has proliferated, with examples ranging from endogenous brain activity and gene-expression patterns to flocks of birds and insect-colony foraging, to name but a few. Some pieces of evidence are quite remarkable, while in some other cases empirical data are limited, incomplete, or not fully convincing. More stringent experimental setups and theoretical analyses are certainly needed to fully clarify the picture. In any case, the time seems ripe for bridging the gap between this theoretical conjecture and its empirical validation. Given the profound implications of shedding light on this issue, it is both pertinent and timely to review the state of the art and to discuss future strategies and perspectives.},

To address this, we made simultaneous surface EEG measurements along with intracortical recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) in the primary visual cortex of behaving nonhuman primates. We found that trial-by-trial fluctuations in EEG power could be explained by a linear combination of LFP power and interelectrode temporal synchrony. This effect was observed in both stimulus and stimulus-free conditions and was particularly strong in the gamma range (30-100 Hz). Subsequently, we used pharmacological manipulations to show that neural synchrony can produce a positively modulated EEG signal even when the LFP signal is negatively modulated. Taken together, our results demonstrate that neural synchrony can modulate EEG signals independently of amplitude changes in neural activity. This finding has strong implications for the interpretation of EEG in basic and clinical research, and helps reconcile EEG response discrepancies observed in different modalities (e.g., EEG vs. functional magnetic resonance imaging) and different spatial scales (e.g., EEG vs. intracranial EEG).},

Here, we show coherent oscillations in the delta frequency band between parietal and frontal cortices during the decision-making component of a somatosensory discrimination task. Importantly, the magnitude of this delta-band coherence is modulated by the different decision alternatives. Furthermore, during control conditions not requiring decision making, delta-band coherences are typically much reduced.

The exact manner in which fluctuations affect spreading dynamics remains poorly known. Recent analytical and numerical studies have demonstrated that improved differential equations for mean and variance of infected individuals reproduce certain regimes of the SIS epidemic model. Here, we show they form a dynamical system that follows Hamilton's equations, which allow us to understand the role of fluctuations and their effects on epidemics. Our findings show the Hamiltonian is a constant of motion for large population sizes. For small populations, finite size effects break the temporal symmetry and induce a power-law decay of the Hamiltonian near the outbreak onset, with a parameter-free exponent. Away from the onset, the Hamiltonian decays exponentially according to a constant relaxation time, which we propose as a metric when fluctuations cannot be neglected.},

  abstract = {Long-range synchrony from short-range interactions is a familiar pattern in biological and physical systems, many of which share a common set of ``universal'' properties at the point of synchronization. Common biological systems of coupled oscillators have been shown to be members of the Ising universality class, meaning that the very simple Ising model replicates certain spatial statistics of these systems at stationarity. This observation is useful because it reveals which aspects of spatial pattern arise independently of the details governing local dynamics, resulting in both deeper understanding of and a simpler baseline model for biological synchrony. However, in many situations a system's dynamics are of greater interest than their static spatial properties. Here, we ask whether a dynamical Ising model can replicate universal and non-universal features of ecological systems, using noisy coupled metapopulation models with two-cycle dynamics as a case study. The standard Ising model makes unrealistic dynamical predictions, but the Ising model with memory corrects this by using an additional parameter to reflect the tendency for local dynamics to maintain their phase of oscillation. By fitting the two parameters of the Ising model with memory to simulated ecological dynamics, we assess the correspondence between the Ising and ecological models in several of their features (location of the critical boundary in parameter space between synchronous and asynchronous dynamics, probability of local phase changes, and ability to predict future dynamics). We find that the Ising model with memory is reasonably good at representing these properties of ecological metapopulations. The correspondence between these models creates the potential for the simple and wellknown Ising class of models to become a valuable tool for understanding complex biological systems.},

However, there was an unprecedented scientific revolution in the 20th century due to one of its most essential innovations, i.e., the information theory, which also encompasses the concept of entropy. Therefore, the following question is naturally raised: ``what is the difference, if any, between concepts of entropy in each field of knowledge?'' There are misconceptions, as there have been multiple attempts to conciliate the entropy of thermodynamics with that of information theory. Entropy is most commonly defined as ``disorder'', although it is not a good analogy since ``order'' is a subjective human concept, and ``disorder'' cannot always be obtained from entropy. Therefore, this paper presents a historical background on the evolution of the term ``entropy'', and provides mathematical evidence and logical arguments regarding its interconnection in various scientific areas, with the objective of providing a theoretical review and reference material for a broad audience.},

For example, the ability of a vector to transduce neurons within a brain structure is often assumed to indicate that all neuron types within the structure are transduced. We have characterized the transduction of mouse somatosensory cortical neuron types by recombinant AAV pseudotyped with serotype 1 capsid (rAAV2/1) and by recombinant lentivirus pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein. Both vectors used human synapsin (hSyn) promoter driving DsRed-Express. We demonstrate that high titer rAAV2/1-hSyn efficiently transduces both cortical excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations, but use of lower titers exposes a strong preference for transduction of cortical inhibitory neurons and layer 5 pyramidal neurons. In contrast, we find that VSV-G-LV-hSyn principally labels excitatory cortical neurons at the highest viral titer generated. These findings demonstrate that endogenous tropism of rAAV2/1 and VSV-G-LV can be used to obtain preferential gene expression in mouse somatosensory cortical inhibitory and excitatory neuron populations, respectively. ?? 2009 IBRO.},

According to the cumulative stress hypothesis, individuals are more likely to suffer from disease as adversity accumulates. According to the mismatch hypothesis, individuals are more likely to suffer from disease if a mismatch occurs between the early programming environment and the later adult environment. These seemingly contradicting hypotheses are integrated into a new model proposing that the cumulative stress hypothesis applies to individuals who were not or only to a small extent programmed by their early environment, while the mismatch hypothesis applies to individuals who experienced strong programming effects. Evidence for the main effects of adversity as well as evidence for the interaction between adversity in early and later life is presented from human observational studies and animal models. Next, convincing evidence for individual differences in sensitivity to programming is presented. We extensively discuss how our integrated model can be tested empirically in animal models and human studies, inviting researchers to test this model. Furthermore, this integrated model should tempt clinicians and other intervenors to interpret symptoms as possible adaptations from an evolutionary biology perspective.},

This paradox is rooted in the nature of the drug market and follows from the dynamics of supply and demand. The attempt at eradication not only has to fail; it actually tends to expand the market. Actually, the war on drugs is not a war at all. However grounded it may be in morality and political expediency, and even though its chosen instruments are the police, the military, and the courts of law, it is an attempt to bring about an economic result - namely, the shrinking and eventual disappearance of a market. This will only succeed if the policies chosen interact properly with the targeted market, and that depends on the market as well as the policies. In fact, the war on drugs generates results nearly the opposite of those intended. The dynamics of the illegal drug market are examined.}

Members of this family are conserved in yeast, invertebrates and vertebrates. The TRP family is subdivided into seven subfamilies: TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melastatin), TRPP (polycystin), TRPML (mucolipin), TRPA (ankyrin) and TRPN (NOMPC-like); the latter is found only in invertebrates and fish. TRP ion channels are widely expressed in many different tissues and cell types, where they are involved in diverse physiological processes, such as sensation of different stimuli or ion homeostasis. Most TRPs are non-selective cation channels, only few are highly Ca2+ selective, some are even permeable for highly hydrated Mg2+ ions. This channel family shows a variety of gating mechanisms, with modes of activation ranging from ligand binding, voltage and changes in temperature to covalent modifications of nucleophilic residues. Activated TRP channels cause depolarization of the cellular membrane, which in turn activates voltage-dependent ion channels, resulting in a change of intracellular Ca2+ concentration; they serve as gatekeeper for transcellular transport of several cations (such as Ca2+ and Mg2+), and are required for the function of intracellular organelles (such as endosomes and lysosomes). Because of their function as intracellular Ca2+ release channels, they have an important regulatory role in cellular organelles. Mutations in several TRP genes have been implicated in diverse pathological states, including neurodegenerative disorders, skeletal dysplasia, kidney disorders and pain, and ongoing research may help find new therapies for treatments of related diseases.},

Neighbouring neurons, in areas from retina to cortex, tend to fire together more often than would be expected by chance. The importance of this correlated firing for encoding visual information is unclear and controversial. Here we examine its importance in the retina. We present the retina with natural stimuli and record the responses of its output cells, the ganglion cells. We then use information theoretic techniques to measure the amount of information about the stimuli that can be obtained from the cells under two conditions: when their correlated firing is taken into account, and when their correlated firing is ignored. We find that more than 90\% of the information about the stimuli can be obtained from the cells when their correlated firing is ignored. This indicates that ganglion cells act largely independently to encode information, which greatly simplifies the problem of decoding their activity.},

  abstract = {It has been known for {$>$}30 years that neuronal spike trains exhibit correlations, that is, the occurrence of a spike at one time is not independent of the occurrence of spikes at other times, both within spike trains from single neurons and across spike trains from multiple neurons. The presence of these correlations has led to the proposal that they might form a key element of the neural code. Specifically, they might act as an extra channel for information, carrying messages about events in the outside world that are not carried by other aspects of the spike trains, such as firing rate. Currently, there is no general consensus about whether this proposal applies to real spike trains in the nervous system. This is largely because it has been hard to separate information carried in correlations from that not carried in correlations. Here we propose a framework for performing this separation.

  abstract = {The concept of a "flow network"-a set of nodes and links which carries one or more flows-unites many different disciplines, including pipe flow, fluid flow, electrical, chemical reaction, ecological, epidemiological, neurological, communications, transportation, financial, economic and human social networks. This Feature Paper presents a generalized maximum entropy framework to infer the state of a flow network, including its flow rates and other properties, in probabilistic form. In this method, the network uncertainty is represented by a joint probability function over its unknowns, subject to all that is known. This gives a relative entropy function which is maximized, subject to the constraints, to determine the most probable or most representative state of the network. The constraints can include "observable" constraints on various parameters, "physical" constraints such as conservation laws and frictional properties, and "graphical" constraints arising from uncertainty in the network structure itself. Since the method is probabilistic, it enables the prediction of network properties when there is insufficient information to obtain a deterministic solution. The derived framework can incorporate nonlinear constraints or nonlinear interdependencies between variables, at the cost of requiring numerical solution. The theoretical foundations of the method are first presented, followed by its application to a variety of flow networks.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, the notion of a neural correlate of consciousness (or NCC) has become a focal point for scientific research on consciousness. Our focus in this paper is one particular way of thinking about the neural correlates of visual consciousness that has become widespread among philosophers of mind and cognitive neuroscientists alike. According to this way of thinking, which we call the matching-content doctrine, the first task of the neuroscience of consciousness is to uncover the neural representational systems whose contents systematically match the contents of consciousness. We believe there are good empirical and philosophical reasons for being suspicious of this matching-content notion of neural correlates of consciousness. There is no reason to think that the neural states that have been shown experimentally to be correlated with conscious visual experiences match those experiences in content; therefore, the experiments to date do not support the matching-content doctrine. In addition, we argue that there is reason to doubt that neural representational systems, at least as standardly conceived in much of the NCC literature, could match visual experiences in content, and therefore that the matching-content doctrine ought to be rejected.

  abstract = {A general conceptual framework for large-scale neocortical dynamics based on data from many laboratories is applied to a variety of experimental designs, spatial scales, and brain states. Partly distinct, but interacting local processes (e.g., neural networks) arise from functional segregation. Global processes arise from functional integration and can facilitate (top down) synchronous activity in remote cell groups that function simultaneously at several different spatial scales. Simultaneous local processes may help drive (bottom up) macroscopic global dynamics observed with electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). A local/global dynamic theory that is consistent with EEG data and the proposed conceptual framework is outlined. This theory is neutral about properties of neural networks embedded in macroscopic fields, but its global component makes several qualitative and semiquantitative predictions about EEG measures of traveling and standing wave phenomena. A more general "metatheory" suggests what large-scale quantitative theories of neocortical dynamics may be like when more accurate treatment of local and nonlinear effects is achieved. The theory describes the dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic action fields. EEG and MEG provide large-scale estimates of modulation of these synaptic fields around background levels. Brain states are determined by neuromodulatory control parameters. Purely local states are dominated by local feedback gains and rise and decay times of postsynaptic potentials. Dominant local frequencies vary with brain region. Other states are purely global, with moderate to high coherence over large distances. Multiple global mode frequencies arise from a combination of delays in corticocortical axons and neocortical boundary conditions. Global frequencies are identical in all cortical regions, but most states involve dynamic interactions between local networks and the global system. EEG frequencies may involve a "matching" of local resonant frequencies with one or more of the many, closely spaced global frequencies.},

  abstract = {The article investigates the mechanisms of selecting and updating representations in declarative and procedural working memory (WM). Declarative WM holds the objects of thought available, whereas procedural WM holds representations of what to do with these objects. Both systems consist of three embedded components: activated long-term memory, a central capacity-limited component for building structures through temporary bindings, and a single-element focus of attention. Five experiments test the hypothesis of analogous mechanisms in declarative and procedural WM, investigating repetition effects across trials for individual representations (objects and responses) and for sets (memory sets and task sets), as well as set-congruency effects. Evidence for analogous processes was obtained from three phenomena: (1) Costs of task switching and of list switching are reduced with longer preparation interval. (2) The effects of task congruency and of list congruency are undiminished with longer preparation interval. (3) Response repetition interacts with task repetition in procedural WM; here we show an analogous interaction of list repetition with item repetition in declarative WM. All three patterns were reproduced by a connectionist model implementing the assumed selection and updating mechanisms. The model consists of two modules, an item-selection module selecting individual items from a memory set, or responses from a task set, and a set-selection module for selecting memory sets or task sets. The model codes the matrix of binding weights in the item-selection module as a pattern of activation in the set-selection module, thereby providing a mechanism for building chunks in LTM, and for unpacking them as structures into working memory.},

It remains unclear why such perturbations do not generate movements and if conditions exist under which they may evoke movements. In this study, we examine the effects of five optogenetic constructs in the macaque frontal eye field and use electrical microstimulation to assess whether optical perturbation of the local network leads to observable motor changes during optical, electrical, and combined stimulation. We report a significant increase in the probability of evoking saccadic eye movements when low current electrical stimulation is coupled to optical stimulation compared with when electrical stimulation is used alone. Experiments combining channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) and electrical stimulation with simultaneous fMRI revealed no discernible fMRI activity at the electrode tip with optical stimulation but strong activity with electrical stimulation. Our findings suggest that stimulation with current ChR2 optogenetic constructs generates subthreshold activity that contributes to the initiation of movements but, in most cases, is not sufficient to evoke a motor response.},

The bio-logically unique phenomenon of viral tropism is not only of interest to virologists to bring progress to their basic science but also highly relevant to clinical studies with the goal to design new anti-viral strategies. Accordingly, " Viral Tropism " must be considered a sibling to another Research Topic in Frontiers in Virology entitled " Receptor usage and pathogenesis in acute and chronic viral infection. " RefeRences Kajitani, N., Satsuka, A., Kawate, A., and Sakai, H. (2012). Productive life cycle of human papillomaviruses that depends upon squamous epithelial differentiation. One of the most important and outstanding characteristics of viruses is their cellular and host tropism (Levine and Enquist, 2007). As parasitic entities, viruses have to compromise with numbers of positive and negative factors present in target cells for their survival. In the absence of an appropriate interaction with cells, they do not replicate at all. Viral tropism therefore can be determined at each replication step, beginning with the entry into cells and ending with the progeny production from cells. There are two major types of viral tropism, that is, the receptor-dependent and -independent tropisms. Restriction of viral replication occurs on the cell sur-face (receptor-dependent viral entry step) and/or intracellularly (receptor-independent post-entry replication steps). In this Research Topic, a number of basic studies on both types of animal virus tropism have been published as either reviews, mini-reviews, or an original research article. Kajitani et al. (2012) have efficiently summarized a unique and complex lifecycle of human papilloma viruses (double-stranded DNA virus). Ohka et al. (2012) have concisely described the receptor-dependent and -independent tropism of poliovirus (positive sense single-stranded RNA virus). Ramadhany et al. (2012) have presented an original study on the mutations in hemagglutinin gene of influenza virus (negative sense single-stranded and segmented RNA virus) and have discussed their effects on the viral tropism. Multiple cellular receptors for measles virus (negative sense single-stranded and segmented RNA virus) have been clearly described by Sato et al. (2012). Takada (2012) has proposed models of filovirus (ebola and Marburg viruses; negative sense single-stranded RNA virus) entry into cells. Yasuda (2012) has discussed the interaction of ebolavirus and anti-viral cellular factor tetherin/BST-2. Species tropism of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIVs; positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses containing reverse transcriptase), a representative of the receptor-independ-ent tropism, has been systematically summarized by Nakayama and Shioda (2012). Sakuma and Takeuchi (2012) has provided insight into the mechanism for species-specific SIV replication. Nomaguchi et al. (2012) have focused on the function of viral accessory proteins, and discussed the bases for HIV-1 species tro-pism. Tani et al. (2011) have described the use of vesicular sto-matitis virus (negative sense single-stranded RNA virus) as tools in various research and medical fields. Finally, Uchiyama (2012) has reviewed the rickettsia tropism as an example of non-viral microbes (obligate intracellular parasitic bacterium).},

We show that these measures are not compatible with a decomposition into unique, shared and synergistic information if one requires that all terms are always non-negative (local positivity). We illustrate the difference between the two measures for multivariate Gaussians.},

  abstract = {In the study of consciousness, neurophenomenology was originally established as a novel research program attempting to reconcile two apparently irreconcilable methodologies in psychology: qualitative and quantitative methods. Its potential relies on Francisco Varela's idea of reciprocal constraints, in which first-person accounts and neurophysiological data mutually inform each other. However, since its first conceptualization, neurophenomenology has encountered methodological problems. These problems have emerged mainly because of the difficulty of obtaining and analyzing subjective reports in a systematic manner. However, more recently, several interview techniques for describing subjective accounts have been developed, collectively known as "second-person methods." Second-person methods refer to interview techniques that solicit both verbal and non-verbal information from participants in order to obtain systematic and detailed subjective reports. Here, we examine the potential for employing second-person methodologies in the neurophenomenological study of consciousness and we propose three practical ideas for developing a second-person neurophenomenological method. Thus, we first describe second-person methodologies available in the literature for analyzing subjective reports, identifying specific constraints on the status of the first-, second- and third- person methods. Second, we analyze two experimental studies that explicitly incorporate second-person methods for traversing the "gap" between phenomenology and neuroscience. Third, we analyze the challenges that second-person accounts face in establishing an objective methodology for comparing results across different participants and interviewers: this is the "validation" problem. Finally, we synthesize the common aspects of the interview methods described above. In conclusion, our arguments emphasize that second-person methods represent a powerful approach for closing the gap between the experiential and the neurobiological levels of description in the study of human consciousness.},

Here we examine the communication patterns of millions of mobile phone users, allowing us to simultaneously study the local and the global structure of a society-wide communication network. We observe a coupling between interaction strengths and the network's local structure, with the counterintuitive consequence that social networks are robust to the removal of the strong ties, but fall apart following a phase transition if the weak ties are removed. We show that this coupling significantly slows the diffusion process, resulting in dynamic trapping of information in communities, and find that when it comes to information diffusion, weak and strong ties are both simultaneously ineffective.},

In various adrenal tumors, aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), Cushing's adrenal adenomas (Cush), pheochromocytomas (Pheo), and adrenal carcinomas, we studied the density, affinity, and subtype of Ang II receptors. Ang II binding was tested in cell membrane homogenates. [125I]Ang II was used as ligand, and Losartan and CGP 42112 were used as selective Ang II type 1 and type 2 antagonists, respectively. In APA, Ang II receptor density was 178.5 {$\pm$} 82.7 fmol/mg: however, due to the high degree of variability, the receptor density was not significantly higher than that in non-tumorous adrenal cortex (59.3 {$\pm$} 8.4 fmol/mg). In Cush, the receptor density (27.6 {$\pm$} 8.2 fmol/mg; P {$<$} 0.05) was significantly lower than that in controls, whereas in Pheo and cortical carcinoma, Ang II binding was very low and in several cases almost undetectable. There was no remarkable difference in the Ang II receptor affinity among all tissues tested. The ratio between type 1 and type 2 Ang II receptors showed a large prevalence of type 1 in controls, APA, and three cases of Cush; in two cases of Cush, this ratio was reversed. In conclusion, our data indicate that Ang II receptors are normally expressed in APA and can also be detected in Cush, whereas they have a very low density in Pheo and adrenal carcinoma. Therefore, Ang II receptors are not involved in the lack of response to Ang II that is characteristic of APA; additionally, a reduction of Ang II receptors can be associated with dedifferentiation or malignancy of adrenal tumors. Further investigation of the expression and functional characterization of Ang II receptors is required to better clarify their possible role in adrenal tumorigenesis.}

Large-scale population recordings have revealed how functional properties and activity dynamics are organized within and across brain regions. Meanwhile, single neurons have been specifically labeled to systematically characterize cell types with distinct morphologies and projection patterns. Combining these approaches, in order to investigate the role of individual, identified neurons in generating neural activity dynamics and behavior, has traditionally been possible only for simple invertebrate systems, but is now becoming feasible in a vertebrate model.},

  abstract = {Information Theory enables the quantification of how much information a neuronal response carries about external stimuli and is hence a natural analytic framework for studying neural coding. The main difficulty in its practical application to spike train analysis is that estimates of neuronal information from experimental data are prone to a systematic error (called "bias"). This bias is an inevitable consequence of the limited number of stimulus-response samples that it is possible to record in a real experiment. In this paper, we first explain the origin and the implications of the bias problem in spike train analysis. We then review and evaluate some recent general-purpose methods to correct for sampling bias: the Panzeri-Treves, Quadratic Extrapolation, Best Universal Bound, Nemenman-Shafee-Bialek procedures, and a recently proposed shuffling bias reduction procedure. Finally, we make practical recommendations for the accurate computation of information from spike trains. Our main recommendation is to estimate information using the shuffling bias reduction procedure in combination with one of the other four general purpose bias reduction procedures mentioned in the preceding text. This provides information estimates with acceptable variance and which are unbiased even when the number of trials per stimulus is as small as the number of possible discrete neuronal responses.},

Usually derived from the human immunodeficiency virus genome, they mediate efficient gene transfer to non-dividing cells, including neurons and glia in the adult mammalian brain. In addition, integration of the recombinant lentiviral construct into the host genome provides permanent expression, including the progeny of dividing neural precursors. In this review, we describe targeted vectors with modified envelope glycoproteins and expression of transgenes under the regulation of cell-selective and inducible promoters. This technology has broad utility to address fundamental questions in neuroscience and we outline how this has been used in rodents and primates. Combining viral tract tracing with immunohistochemistry and confocal or electron microscopy, lentiviral vectors provide a tool to selectively label and trace specific neuronal populations at gross or ultrastructural levels. Additionally, new generation optogenetic technologies can be readily utilized to analyze neuronal circuit and gene functions in the mature mammalian brain. Examples of these applications, limitations of current systems and prospects for future developments to enhance neuroscience knowledge will be reviewed. Finally, we will discuss how these vectors may be translated from gene therapy trials into the clinical setting.},

For this problem (i) we propose a metric to quantify the difficulty of the control problem as a function of the required control energy, (ii) we derive bounds based on the system dynamics (network topology and weights) to characterize the tradeoff between the control energy and the number of control nodes, and (iii) we propose a distributed strategy with performance guarantees for the control of complex networks. In our strategy we select control nodes by relying on network partitioning, and we design the control input by leveraging optimal and distributed control techniques. Our findings show for instance that (i) if the number of control nodes is constant, then the control energy increases exponentially with the number of the network nodes, (ii) if the number of control nodes is a fixed fraction of the network nodes, then certain networks can be controlled with constant energy independently of the network dimension, and (iii) clustered networks may be easier to control because, for sufficiently many control nodes, the control energy depends only on the controllability properties of the clusters and on their coupling strength. We validate our results with examples from power networks, social networks, and epidemics spreading.},

  abstract = {Human white matter integrity has been related to information processing speed, but it is unknown whether impaired integrity results from localized processes or is a general property shared across white matter tracts. Based on diffusion MRI scans of 132 healthy individuals with a narrow age range around 72 years, the integrity of eight major white matter tracts was quantified using probabilistic neighborhood tractography. Principal component analyses (PCAs) were conducted on the correlations between the eight tracts, separately for four tract-averaged integrity parameters: fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and radial and axial diffusivity. For all four parameters, the PCAs revealed a single general factor explaining approximately 45\% of the individual differences across all eight tracts. Individuals' scores on a general factor that captures the common variance in white matter integrity had significant associations with a general factor of information processing speed for fractional anisotropy (r = -0.24, p = 0.007) and radial diffusivity (r = 0.21, p = 0.016), but not with general intelligence or memory factors. Individual tracts showed no associations beyond what the common integrity factor explained. Just as different types of cognitive ability tests share much of their variance, these novel findings show that a substantial amount of variance in white matter integrity is shared between different tracts. Therefore, impaired cortical connection is substantially a global process affecting various major tracts simultaneously. Further studies should investigate whether these findings relate more to the role of tract integrity and information processing speed in nonpathological cognitive aging or in lifelong-stable processes.},

  abstract = {The brain appears to adhere to two fundamental principles of functional organisation, functional integration and functional specialisation, where the integration within and among specialised areas is mediated by effective connectivity. In this paper, we review two different approaches to modelling effective connectivity from fMRI data, structural equation models (SEMs) and dynamic causal models (DCMs). In common to both approaches are model comparison frameworks in which inferences can be made about effective connectivity per se and about how that connectivity can be changed by perceptual or cognitive set. Underlying the two approaches, however, are two very different generative models. In DCM, a distinction is made between the 'neuronal level' and the 'hemodynamic level'. Experimental inputs cause changes in effective connectivity expressed at the level of neurodynamics, which in turn cause changes in the observed hemodynamics. In SEM, changes in effective connectivity lead directly to changes in the covariance structure of the observed hemodynamics. Because changes in effective connectivity in the brain occur at a neuronal level DCM is the preferred model for fMRI data. This review focuses on the underlying assumptions and limitations of each model and demonstrates their application to data from a study of attention to visual motion. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, we often need to do it within a given time window, so it is of practical importance to understand the trade-offs between the minimum number of driving/driven nodes and the minimum time required to reach a desired state. Therefore, we introduce the notion of actuation spectrum to capture such trade-offs, which we used to find that in many complex networks only a small fraction of driving (or driven) nodes is required to steer the network to a desired state within a relatively small time window. Furthermore, our empirical studies reveal that, even though synthetic network models are designed to present structural properties similar to those observed in real networks, their actuation spectra can be dramatically different. Thus, it supports the need to develop new synthetic network models able to replicate controllability properties of real-world networks.},

Here, we review recent advances in the study of evolutionary dynamics of group interactions on top of structured populations, including lattices, complex networks and coevolutionary models. We also compare these results with those obtained on well-mixed populations. The review particularly highlights that the study of the dynamics of group interactions, like several other important equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamical processes in biological, economical and social sciences, benefits from the synergy between statistical physics, network science and evolutionary game theory.},

The evolutionary success of our species is indeed due, to a large degree, to our unparalleled other-regarding abilities. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of human cooperation remains a formidable challenge. Recent research in the social sciences indicates that it is important to focus on the collective behavior that emerges as the result of the interactions among individuals, groups, and even societies. Non-equilibrium statistical physics, in particular Monte Carlo methods and the theory of collective behavior of interacting particles near phase transition points, has proven to be very valuable for understanding counterintuitive evolutionary outcomes. By treating models of human cooperation as classical spin models, a physicist can draw on familiar settings from statistical physics. However, unlike pairwise interactions among particles that typically govern solid-state physics systems, interactions among humans often involve group interactions, and they also involve a larger number of possible states even for the most simplified description of reality. The complexity of solutions therefore often surpasses that observed in physical systems. Here we review experimental and theoretical research that advances our understanding of human cooperation, focusing on spatial pattern formation, on the spatiotemporal dynamics of observed solutions, and on self-organization that may either promote or hinder socially favorable states.},

  abstract = {Neuronal circuitry is often considered a clean slate that can be dynamically and arbitrarily molded by experience. However, when we investigated synaptic connectivity in groups of pyramidal neurons in the neocortex, we found that both connectivity and synaptic weights were surprisingly predictable. Synaptic weights follow very closely the number of connections in a group of neurons, saturating after only 20\% of possible connections are formed between neurons in a group. When we examined the network topology of connectivity between neurons, we found that the neurons cluster into small world networks that are not scale-free, with less than 2 degrees of separation. We found a simple clustering rule where connectivity is directly proportional to the number of common neighbors, which accounts for these small world networks and accurately predicts the connection probability between any two neurons. This pyramidal neuron network clusters into multiple groups of a few dozen neurons each. The neurons composing each group are surprisingly distributed, typically more than 100 {$\mu$}m apart, allowing for multiple groups to be interlaced in the same space. In summary, we discovered a synaptic organizing principle that groups neurons in a manner that is common across animals and hence, independent of individual experiences. We speculate that these elementary neuronal groups are prescribed Lego-like building blocks of perception and that acquired memory relies more on combining these elementary assemblies into higher-order constructs.},

  abstract = {The activity of cortical neurons is determined by the input they receive from presynaptic neurons. Many previous studies have investigated how specific aspects of the statistics of the input affect the spike trains of single neurons and neurons in recurrent networks. However, typically very simple random network models are considered in such studies. Here we use a recently developed algorithm to construct networks based on a quasi-fractal probability measure which are much more variable than commonly used network models, and which therefore promise to sample the space of recurrent networks in a more exhaustive fashion than previously possible. We use the generated graphs as the underlying network topology in simulations of networks of integrate-and-fire neurons in an asynchronous and irregular state. Based on an extensive dataset of networks and neuronal simulations we assess statistical relations between features of the network structure and the spiking activity. Our results highlight the strong influence that some details of the network structure have on the activity dynamics of both single neurons and populations, even if some global network parameters are kept fixed. We observe specific and consistent relations between activity characteristics like spike-train irregularity or correlations and network properties, for example the distributions of the numbers of in- and outgoing connections or clustering. Exploiting these relations, we demonstrate that it is possible to estimate structural characteristics of the network from activity data. We also assess higher order correlations of spiking activity in the various networks considered here, and find that their occurrence strongly depends on the network structure. These results provide directions for further theoretical studies on recurrent networks, as well as new ways to interpret spike train recordings from neural circuits.},

Such correlations have been studied in much detail, both with respect to their mechanistic origin and to their influence on stimulus discrimination and on the performance of population codes. In particular, recurrent neural network models have been used to understand the origin (or lack) of correlations in neural activity. Here, we apply a model of recurrently connected stochastic neurons to interpret correlations found in a population of neurons recorded from mouse auditory cortex. We study the consequences of recurrent connections on the stimulus dependence of correlations, and we compare them to those from alternative sources of correlated variability, like correlated gain fluctuations and common input in feed-forward architectures. We find that a recurrent network model with random effective connections reproduces observed statistics, like the relation between noise and signal correlations in the data, in a natural way. In the model, we can analyze directly the relation between network parameters, correlations, and how well pairs of stimuli can be discriminated based on population activity. In this way, we can relate circuit parameters to information processing.},

This target article presents a taxonomy of perceptual completion phenomena to organize and clarify theoretical and empirical discussion. Examples of boundary completion (illusory contours) and featural completion (color, brightness, motion, texture, and depth) are examined, and single-cell studies relevant to filling-in are reviewed and assessed. Filling-in issues must be understood in relation to theoretical issues about neural-perceptual isomorphism and linking propositions. Six main conclusions are drawn: (1) visual filling-in comprises a multitude of different perceptual completion phenomena; (2) certain forms of visual completion seem to involve spatially propagating neural activity (neural filling-in) and so, contrary to Dennett's (1991; 1992) recent discussion of filling-in, cannot be described as results of the brain's "ignoring an absence" or "jumping to a conclusion"; (3) in certain cases perceptual completion seems to have measurable effects that depend on neural signals representing a presence rather than ignoring an absence; (4) neural filling-in does not imply either "analytic isomorphism" or "Cartesian materialism," and thus the notion of the bridge locus--a particular neural stage that forms the immediate substrate of perceptual experience--is problematic and should be abandoned; (5) to reject the representational conception of vision in favor of an "enactive" or "animate" conception reduces the importance of filling-in as a theoretical category in the explanation of vision; and (6) the evaluation of perceptual content should not be determined by "subpersonal" considerations about internal processing, but rather by considerations about the task of vision at the level of the animal or person interacting with the world.},

  abstract = {Neurophenomenology, as an attempt to combine and mutually enlighten neural and experiential descriptions of cognitive processes, has met practical difficulties which have limited its implementation into actual research projects. The main difficulty seems to be the disparity of the levels of description: while neurophenomenology strongly emphasizes the micro-dynamics of experience, at the level of brief mental events with very specific content, most neural measures have much coarser functional selectivity, because they mix functionally heterogeneous neural processes either in space or in time. We propose a new starting point for this neurophenomenology, based on (a) the recent development of human intra-cerebral EEG (iEEG) research to highlight the neural micro-dynamics of human cognition, with millimetric and millisecond precision and (b) a disciplined access to the experiential micro-dynamics, through specific elicitation techniques. This lays the foundation for a microcognitive science, the practical implementation of neurophenomenology to combine the neural and experiential investigations of human cognition at the subsecond level.},

In addition, the connections of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortical areas were re-examined in the monkey. The present analysis showed that only a restricted portion of what had previously been labelled as area 46 in the monkey has the same characteristics as area 46 of the human brain; the remaining part of this monkey region has the characteristics of a portion of the middle frontal gyrus in the human brain that had previously been included as part of area 9. We have labelled this cortical area as 9/46 in both species. These two areas (i.e. 46 and 9/46), which constitute the lower half of the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex, have a well-developed granular layer IV, and can easily be distinguished from area 9, on the upper part of the mid-dorsolateral region, which does not have a well-developed granular layer IV. Area 9 has the same basic pattern of connections as areas 46 and 9/46, but, unlike the latter areas, it does not receive input from the lateral parietal cortex. Caudal to area 9, on the dorsomedial portion of the frontal cortex, there is a distinct strip of cortex (area 8B) which, unlike area 9, receives significant input from the prestriate cortex and the medial parietal cortex. The present results provide a basis for a closer integration of findings from functional neuroimaging studies in human subjects with experimental work in the monkey.},

As the two complexity measures are based on the calculation of informational entropy, an equivalent information source is defined by using partitions of the dynamical variable range. During the time intervals, the information associated with the measured dynamical variable is the seed to calculate instantaneous LMC and SDL measures. To show how the methodology works generating indicators, two examples, one concerning meteorological data and the other concerning economic data, are presented and discussed.}

In most invivo optogenetic experiments, light is delivered into the brain through a single optical fiber. However, this approach limits illumination to a fixed volume of the brain. Here a focused ion beam is used to pattern multiple light windows on a tapered optical fiber. We show that such fibers allow selective and dynamic illumination of different brain regions along the taper. Site selection is achieved by a simple coupling strategy at the fiber input, and the use of asingle tapered waveguide minimizes the implant invasiveness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for multipoint optical stimulation in the mammalian brain invivo by coupling the fiber to a microelectrode array and performing simultaneous extracellular recording and stimulation at multiple sites in the mouse striatum and cerebral cortex. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The association between embryonic errors and the development of autism has been recognized in the literature, but the mechanism underlying this association remains unknown. We propose that pleiotropic effects during a very early and specific stage of embryonic development-early organogenesis-can explain this association. In humans early organogenesis is an embryonic stage, spanning Day 20 to Day 40 after fertilization, which is characterized by intense interactivity among body parts of the embryo. This implies that a single mutation or environmental disturbance affecting development at this stage can have several phenotypic effects (i.e., pleiotropic effects). Disturbances during early organogenesis can lead to many different anomalies, including limb deformities, craniofacial malformations, brain pathology, and anomalies in other organs. We reviewed the literature and found ample evidence for the association between autism and different kinds of physical anomalies, which agrees with the hypothesis that pleiotropic effects are involved in the development of autism. The proposed mechanism integrates findings from a variety of studies on autism, including neurobiological studies and studies on physical anomalies and prenatal influences on neurodevelopmental outcomes. The implication is that the origin of autism can be much earlier in embryologic development than has been frequently reported.},

We present a simple approach for estimating the dynamics of the calcium indicator as well as the observation noise statistics from the observed data. These parameters are then used to set up the matrix factorization problem in a constrained form that requires no further parameter tuning.

It also aims at defining various desirable properties of causal relationships, such as specificity, proportionality and stability. Here we apply an information-theoretic approach to these properties. We show that the interventionist criterion of causation is formally equivalent to non-zero specificity, and that there are natural, information-theoretic ways to explicate the distinction between potential and actual causal influence. We explicate the idea that the description of causes should be proportional to that of their effects. Then we draw a distinction between two ideas in the existing literature, the range of invariance of a causal relationship and its stability. The range of invariance is related to specificity and range of causal values. Stability concerns the effect of additional variables on the relationship between some focal pair of cause and effect variables. We show how to distinguish and measure the direct influence of background variables on the effect variable, and their influence on the relationship between the focal cause and the effect variable. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the information-theoretic approach, and offer prospects for complementary approaches.},

One particular practice that has become common is 'reverse inference', by which the engagement of a particular cognitive process is inferred from the activation of a particular brain region. Such inferences are not deductively valid, but can still provide some information. Using a Bayesian analysis of the BrainMap neuroimaging database, I characterize the amount of additional evidence in favor of the engagement of a cognitive process that can be offered by a reverse inference. Its usefulness is particularly limited by the selectivity of activation in the region of interest. I argue that cognitive neuroscientists should be circumspect in the use of reverse inference, particularly when selectivity of the region in question cannot be established or is known to be weak. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Estimating and optimizing Mutual Information (MI) is core to many problems in machine learning; however, bounding MI in high dimensions is challenging. To establish tractable and scalable objectives, recent work has turned to variational bounds parameterized by neural networks, but the relationships and tradeoffs between these bounds remains unclear. In this work, we unify these recent developments in a single framework. We find that the existing variational lower bounds degrade when the MI is large, exhibiting either high bias or high variance. To address this problem, we introduce a continuum of lower bounds that encompasses previous bounds and flexibly trades off bias and variance. On high-dimensional, controlled problems, we empirically characterize the bias and variance of the bounds and their gradients and demonstrate the effectiveness of our new bounds for estimation and representation learning.},

  abstract = {Despite their proven efficacy in treating neurological disorders, especially Parkinson's disease, deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems could be further optimized to maximize treatment benefits. In particular, because current open-loop DBS strategies based on fixed stimulation settings leave the typical parkinsonian motor fluctuations and rapid symptom variations partly uncontrolled, research has for several years focused on developing novel "closed-loop" or "adaptive" DBS (aDBS) systems. aDBS consists of a simple closed-loop model designed to measure and analyze a control variable reflecting the patient's clinical condition to elaborate new stimulation settings and send them to an "intelligent" implanted stimulator. The major problem in developing an aDBS system is choosing the ideal control variable for feedback. Here we review current evidence on the advantages of neurosignal-controlled aDBS that uses local field potentials (LFPs) as a control variable, and describe the technology already available to create new aDBS systems, and the potential benefits of aDBS for patients with Parkinson's disease. \textcopyright{} 2012.},

  abstract = {The random forest algorithm (RF) has several hyperparameters that have to be set by the user, e.g., the number of observations drawn randomly for each tree and whether they are drawn with or without replacement, the number of variables drawn randomly for each split, the splitting rule, the minimum number of samples that a node must contain and the number of trees. In this paper, we first provide a literature review on the parameters' influence on the prediction performance and on variable importance measures, also considering interactions between hyperparameters. It is well known that in most cases RF works reasonably well with the default values of the hyperparameters specified in software packages. Nevertheless, tuning the hyperparameters can improve the performance of RF. In the second part of this paper, after a brief overview of tuning strategies we demonstrate the application of one of the most established tuning strategies, model-based optimization (MBO). To make it easier to use, we provide the tuneRanger R package that tunes RF with MBO automatically. In a benchmark study on several datasets, we compare the prediction performance and runtime of tuneRanger with other tuning implementations in R and RF with default hyperparameters.},

  abstract = {It is notoriously difficult to predict the behaviour of a complex self-organizing system, where the interactions among dynamical units form a heterogeneous topology. Even if the dynamics of each microscopic unit is known, a real understanding of their contributions to the macroscopic system behaviour is still lacking. Here, we develop information-theoretical methods to distinguish the contribution of each individual unit to the collective out-of-equilibrium dynamics. We show that for a system of units connected by a network of interaction potentials with an arbitrary degree distribution, highly connected units have less impact on the system dynamics when compared with intermediately connected units. In an equilibrium setting, the hubs are often found to dictate the long-term behaviour. However, we find both analytically and experimentally that the instantaneous states of these units have a short-lasting effect on the state trajectory of the entire system. We present qualitative evidence of this phenomenon from empirical findings about a social network of product recommendations, a protein-protein interaction network and a neural network, suggesting that it might indeed be a widespread property in nature.},

The largest crash in the past decades is the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers which was followed by a trust-based crisis between banks due to high-risk trading in complex products. We introduce information dissipation length (IDL) as a leading indicator of global instability of dynamical systems based on the transmission of Shannon information, and apply it to the time series of USD and EUR interest rate swaps (IRS). We find in both markets that the IDL steadily increases toward the bankruptcy, then peaks at the time of bankruptcy, and decreases afterwards. Previously introduced indicators such as 'critical slowing down' do not provide a clear leading indicator. Our results suggest that the IDL may be used as an early-warning signal for critical transitions even in the absence of a predictive model.},

  abstract = {Claude Shannons information theory (1949) has had a revolutionary impact on communication science. A crucial property of his framework is that it decouples the meaning of a message from the mechanistic details from the actual communication process itself, which opened the way to solve long-standing communication problems. Here we argue that a similar impact could be expected by applying information theory in the context of complexity science to answer long-standing, cross-domain questions about the nature of complex systems. This happens by decoupling the domain-specific model details (e.g., neuronal networks, ecosystems, flocks of birds) from the cross-domain phenomena that characterize complex systems (e.g., criticality, robustness, tipping points). This goes beyond using information theory as a non-linear correlation measure, namely it allows describing a complex system entirely in terms of the storage, transfer, and modification of informational bits. After all, a phenomenon that does not depend on model details should best be studied in a framework that strips away all such details. We highlight the first successes of information-theoretic descriptions in the recent complexity literature, and emphasize that this type of research is still in its infancy. Finally we sketch how such an information-theoretic description may even lead to a new type of universality among complex systems, with a potentially tremendous impact. The goal of this perspective article is to motivate a paradigm shift in the young field of complexity science using a lesson learnt in communication science.},

Information synergy occurs when multiple sources together predict an outcome variable better than the sum of single-source predictions. It is an essential phenomenon in biology such as in neuronal networks and cellular regulatory processes, where different information flows integrate to produce a single response, but also in social cooperation processes as well as in statistical inference tasks in machine learning. Here we propose a metric of synergistic entropy and synergistic information from first principles. The proposed measure relies on so-called synergistic random variables (SRVs) which are constructed to have zero mutual information about individual source variables but non-zero mutual information about the complete set of source variables. We prove several basic and desired properties of our measure, including bounds and additivity properties. In addition, we prove several important consequences of our measure, including the fact that different types of synergistic information may co-exist between the same sets of variables. A numerical implementation is provided, which we use to demonstrate that synergy is associated with resilience to noise. Our measure may be a marked step forward in the study of multivariate information theory and its numerous applications.},

Monkeys could bridge the delay by remembering the sample (a sensory-related code) and/or thinking ahead to the expected target (a prospective code). Examination of the monkeys' behavior suggested that they were relying on a prospective code. During and shortly after sample presentation, neural activity in the lateral PF cortex primarily reflected the sample. Toward the end of the delay, however, PF activity began to reflect the anticipated target, which indicated a prospective code. These results provide further confirmation that PF cortex does not simply buffer incoming visual inputs, but instead selectively processes information relevant to current behavioral demands, even when this information must be recalled from long-term memory.},

  abstract = {We studied the timecourse of neural activity in the primate (Macacca mulatta) prefrontal (PF) cortex during an object delayed-matching-to-sample (DMS) task. To assess the effects of experience on this timecourse, we conducted the task using both novel and highly familiar objects. In addition, noise patterns containing no task-relevant information were used as samples on some trials. Comparison of average PF ensemble activity relative to baseline activity generated by objects and noise patterns revealed three distinct activity periods. (i) Sample onset elicited a transient sensory visual response. In this sensory period, novel objects elicited stronger average ensemble activity than both familiar objects and noise patterns. (ii) An intermediate period of elevated activity followed, which began before sample offset, and continued well into the delay period. In the intermediate period, activity was elevated for noise patterns and novel objects, but near baseline for familiar objects. (iii) Finally, after average ensemble activity reached baseline activity at the end of the intermediate period, a reactivation period occurred late in the delay. Experience had little effect during reactivation, where activity was elevated for both novel and familiar objects compared to noise patterns. We show that the ensemble average resembles the activity timecourse of many single prefrontal neurons. These results suggest that PF delay activity does not merely maintain recent sensory input, but is subject to more complex experience-dependent dynamics. This has implications for how delay activity is generated and maintained.},

  abstract = {Social technologies have made it possible to propagate disinformation and manipulate the masses at an unprecedented scale. This is particularly alarming from a security perspective, as humans have proven to be the weakest link when protecting critical infrastructure in general, and the power grid in particular. Here, we consider an attack in which an adversary attempts to manipulate the behavior of energy consumers by sending fake discount notifications encouraging them to shift their consumption into the peak-demand period. We conduct surveys to assess the propensity of people to follow-through on such notifications and forward them to their friends. This allows us to model how the disinformation propagates through social networks. Finally, using Greater London as a case study, we show that disinformation can indeed be used to orchestrate an attack wherein unwitting consumers synchronize their energy-usage patterns, resulting in blackouts on a city-scale. These findings demonstrate that in an era when disinformation can be weaponized, system vulnerabilities arise not only from the hardware and software of critical infrastructure, but also from the behavior of the consumers.},

For these functions, the gamma rhythm frequency must be consistent across neural assemblies encoding the features of a stimulus. Here we test the dependence of gamma frequency on stimulus contrast in V1 cortex of awake behaving macaques and show that gamma frequency increases monotonically with contrast. Changes in stimulus contrast over time leads to a reliable gamma frequency modulation on a fast timescale. Further, large stimuli whose contrast varies across space generate gamma rhythms at significantly different frequencies in simultaneously recorded neuronal assemblies separated by as little as 400 microm, making the gamma rhythm a poor candidate for binding or communication, at least in V1. Instead, our results suggest that the gamma rhythm arises from local interactions between excitation and inhibition.},

  abstract = {We suggest that the hippocampus plays two roles that allow rodents to solve the hidden-platform water maze: self-localization and route replay. When an animal explores an environment such as the water maze, the combination of place fields and correlational (Hebbian) long-term potentiation produces a weight matrix in the CA3 recurrent collaterals such that cells with overlapping place fields are more strongly interconnected than cells with nonoverlapping fields. When combined with global inhibition, this forms an attractor with coherent representations of position as stable states. When biased by local view information, this allows the animal to determine its position relative to the goal when it returns to the environment. We call this self-localization. When an animal traces specific routes within an environment, the weights in the CA3 recurrent collaterals become asymmetric. We show that this stores these routes in the recurrent collaterals. When primed with noise in the absence of sensory input, a coherent representation of position still forms in the CA3 population, but then that representation drifts, retracing a route. We show that these two mechanisms can coexist and form a basis for memory consolidation, explaining the anterograde and limited retrograde amnesia seen following hippocampal lesions.},

Normally, the algorithm used in this method presents high computational times, being necessary to choose suitable control volume sizes, which gives reliable results in moderate simulation times. The use of high-level languages (Python, MATLAB) over low-level languages (C, Fortran) usually aggravates this scenario, as it is slower despite being easier to use. The current study presents a simple method for speeding up the MC simulation of polymerization reactions. First, the code itself is optimized to reduce by half the computational time required compared with the original code, and then a benchmark of pure Python and Python with Numba is made. The results show a drop in the computational times above 99\% when using Numba instead of pure Python codes.}

Persistent technical improvement has focused on the identification of new opsins, suitable for optogenetic purposes and genetic engineering of existing ones. Optical stimulation can be combined with various readouts defined by the desired resolution of the experimental setup. Although recent developments in optogenetics have largely focused on neuroscience it has lately been extended to other targets, including stem cell research and regenerative medicine.

In this paper, we address the generalized network-dismantling problem, which aims at finding a set of nodes whose removal from the network results in the fragmentation of the network into subcritical network components at minimal overall cost. Compared with previous formulations, we allow the costs of node removals to take arbitrary nonnegative real values, which may depend on topological properties such as node centrality or on nontopological features such as the price or protection level of a node. Interestingly, we show that nonunit costs imply a significantly different dismantling strategy. To solve this optimization problem, we propose a method which is based on the spectral properties of a node-weighted Laplacian operator and combine it with a fine-tuning mechanism related to the weighted vertex cover problem. The proposed method is applicable to large-scale networks with millions of nodes. It outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and opens more directions for understanding the vulnerability and robustness of complex systems.},

Our research reveals that corruption runs in small groups that rarely comprise more than eight people, in networks that have hubs and a modular structure that encompasses more than one corruption scandal. We observe abrupt changes in the size of the largest connected component and in the degree distribution, which are due to the coalescence of different modules when newscandals come to light or when governments change.We showfurther that the dynamical structure of political corruption networks can be used for successfully predicting partners in future scandals.

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are used to simulate from complex statistical distributions by way of a local exploration of these distributions. This local feature avoids heavy requests on understanding the nature of the target, but it also potentially induces a lengthy exploration of this target, with a requirement on the number of simulations that grows with the dimension of the problem and with the complexity of the data behind it. Several techniques are available toward accelerating the convergence of these Monte Carlo algorithms, either at the exploration level (as in tempering, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and partly deterministic methods) or at the exploitation level (with Rao\textendash Blackwellization and scalable methods).

  abstract = {Transitions to chaos in archetypal low-dimensional nonlinear maps offer real and precise model systems in which to assess proposed generalizations of statistical mechanics. The known association of chaotic dynamics with the structure of Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics has suggested the potential verification of these generalizations at the onset of chaos, when the only Lyapunov exponent vanishes and ergodic and mixing properties cease to hold. There are three well-known routes to chaos in these deterministic dissipative systems, period-doubling, quasi-periodicity and intermittency, which provide the setting in which to explore the limit of validity of the standard BG structure. It has been shown that there is a rich and intricate behavior for both the dynamics within and towards the attractors at the onset of chaos and that these two kinds of properties are linked via generalized statistical-mechanical expressions. Amongst the topics presented are: (i) permanently growing sensitivity fluctuations and their infinite family of generalized Pesin identities; (ii) the emergence of statistical-mechanical structures in the dynamics along the routes to chaos; (iii) dynamical hierarchies with modular organization; and (iv) limit distributions of sums of deterministic variables. The occurrence of generalized entropy properties in condensed-matter physical systems is illustrated by considering critical fluctuations, localization transition and glass formation. We complete our presentation with the description of the manifestations of the dynamics at the transitions to chaos in various kinds of complex systems, such as, frequency and size rank distributions and complex network images of time series. We discuss the results. \textcopyright{} 2013 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The stress response includes the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex and catecholamines from the adrenal medulla and sympathetic nerves. These stress hormones, in turn, provide feedback to the brain and influence neural structures that control emotion and cognition. To illustrate this influence, we focus on how it impacts fear conditioning, a behavioral paradigm widely used to study the neural mechanisms underlying the acquisition, expression, consolidation, reconsolidation, and extinction of emotional memories. We also discuss how stress and the endocrine mediators of the stress response influence the morphological and electrophysiological properties of neurons in brain areas that are crucial for fear-conditioning processes, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. The information in this review illuminates the behavioral and cellular events that underlie the feedforward and feedback networks that mediate states of fear and stress and their interaction in the brain.},

Results of several experiments in animals provide support for this idea. In humans, gamma oscillations have been described both on the scalp (measured by electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography) and in intracortical recordings, but no direct participation of synchrony in a cognitive task has been demonstrated so far. Here we record electrical brain activity from subjects who are viewing ambiguous visual stimuli (perceived either as faces or as meaningless shapes). We show for the first time, to our knowledge, that only face perception induces a long-distance pattern of synchronization, corresponding to the moment of perception itself and to the ensuing motor response. A period of strong desynchronization marks the transition between the moment of perception and the motor response. We suggest that this desynchronization reflects a process of active uncoupling of the underlying neural ensembles that is necessary to proceed from one cognitive state to another.},

Based on a qualitative study, consisting of 73 interviews with public and private actors, an analysis of 10 criminal investigations and field visits to public and private organisations in the port, this article examines how organised crime groups involved in cocaine trafficking take advantage of or adapt to the socio-spatial relations in the Port of Rotterdam. First, we pay attention to which physical spaces in the port of Rotterdam provide opportunities for cocaine trafficking. Second, we examine how the occupational and legal environment in which people, private companies and law enforcement agencies in the port work and interact provide opportunities for cocaine trafficking. Our findings demonstrate that increased security measures by both public and private actors directed at physical spaces result in a displacement to new spaces in and around the port of Rotterdam. Furthermore, the current socio-spatial relations in the port of Rotterdam also make the role of people on the inside \textendash{} referring to a whole range of public and private employees \textendash{} increasingly indispensable.},

The default mode network was interrogated by means of decreases in brain activity, termed deactivations, during a visual encoding task and during a nonspatial working memory task. Deactivation was found in the default mode network involving the anterior frontal, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex. MCI patients showed less deactivation than HC, but more than AD. The most pronounced differences between MCI, HC, and AD occurred in the very early phase of deactivation, reflecting the reactivity and adaptation of the network. The default mode network response in the anterior frontal cortex significantly distinguished MCI from both HC (in the medial frontal) and AD (in the anterior cingulate cortex). The response in the precuneus could only distinguish between patients and HC, not between MCI and AD. These findings may be consistent with the notion that MCI is a transitional state between healthy aging and dementia and with the proposed early changes in MCI in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. These findings suggest that altered activity in the default mode network may act as an early marker for AD pathology.},

While self-organising processes have been traditionally explained by the tendency of dynamical systems to evolve towards specific configurations, or attractors, we see self-organisation as a consequence of the interdependencies that those attractors induce. Building on this intuition, in this work we develop a theoretical framework for understanding and quantifying self-organisation based on coupled dynamical systems and multivariate information theory. We propose a metric of global structural strength that identifies when self-organisation appears, and a multi-layered decomposition that explains the emergent structure in terms of redundant and synergistic interdependencies. We illustrate our framework on elementary cellular automata, showing how it can detect and characterise the emergence of complex structures.},

However, the adoption of these approaches has been hindered by there being multiple possible decompositions, and no precise guidance for preferring one over the others. At the heart of this disagreement lies the absence of a clear operational interpretation of what synergistic information is. Here we fill this gap by proposing a new information decomposition based on a novel operationalisation of informational synergy, which leverages recent developments in the literature of data privacy. Our decomposition is defined for any number of information sources, and its atoms can be calculated using elementary optimisation techniques. The decomposition provides a natural coarse-graining that scales gracefully with the system's size, and is applicable in a wide range of scenarios of practical interest.},

While this variability is presumed to arise from overlapping synaptic input, its precise relationship to local circuit architecture remains unclear. We combine computational models and in vivo recordings to study the relationship between the spatial structure of connectivity and correlated variability in neural circuits. Extending the theory of networks with balanced excitation and inhibition, we find that spatially localized lateral projections promote weakly correlated spiking, but broader lateral projections produce a distinctive spatial correlation structure: nearby neuron pairs are positively correlated, pairs at intermediate distances are negatively correlated and distant pairs are weakly correlated. This non-monotonic dependence of correlation on distance is revealed in a new analysis of recordings from superficial layers of macaque primary visual cortex. Our findings show that incorporating distance-dependent connectivity improves the extent to which balanced network theory can explain correlated neural variability.},

We find that hypertonic solutions do not act through changes in intracellular calcium. Since the release produced by action potentials and hypertonic solutions varies in parallel as the pool size is changed, we conclude that the same pool is shared by both mechanisms. This conclusion, taken together with other observations in the literature, means that the synaptic release probability depends on the size of the readily releasable pool.},

  abstract = {When a single neuron is grown on a small island of glial cells, the neuron forms synapses onto itself. The so-called autaptic culture systems have proven extremely valuable in elucidating basic mechanisms of synaptic transmission, as they allow application of technical approaches that cannot be used in slice preparations. However, this method has been almost exclusively used for pyramidal cells and interneurons. In this study, we generated autaptic cultures from granule cells isolated from the dentate gyrus of rodent hippocampi. Our subsequent morphological and functional characterisation of these cells confirms that this culture model is suitable for investigating basic mechanisms of granule cell synaptic transmission. Importantly, the autosynaptic connectivity allows recordings of pure mossy fibre miniature EPSCs, which are not possible in slice preparations. Further, by fast application of hypertonic sucrose solutions it is possible to directly measure the readily releasable pool and to calculate the probability of vesicular release.},

Previous studies of auditory plasticity have described experience-dependent changes in response profiles of single neurons or changes in global tonotopic organization. However, experience-dependent changes in the dynamics of local neural populations have remained unexplored. In this study, we examined the influence of a dramatic yet natural experience in the life of female mice, giving birth and becoming a mother on single neurons and neuronal ensembles in the primary auditory cortex (A1). Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings from layer 2/3 in A1 of mothers and age-matched virgin mice, we monitored changes in the responses to a set of artificial and natural sounds. Population dynamics underwent large changes as measured by pairwise and higher-order correlations, with noise correlations increasing as much as twofold in lactating mothers. Concomitantly, changes in response properties of single neurons were modest and selective. Remarkably, despite the large changes in correlations, information about stimulus identity remained essentially the same in the two groups. Our results demonstrate changes in the correlation structure of neuronal activity as a result of a natural life event.},

Many authors have produced more robust versions of this estimator by replacing the square by something else, such as the absolute value. In this article a different approach is introduced in which the sum is replaced by the median of the squared residuals. The resulting estimator can resist the effect of nearly 50\% of contamination in the data. In the special case of simple regression, it corresponds to finding the narrowest strip covering half of the observations. Generalizations are possible to multivariate location, orthogonal regression, and hypothesis testing in linear models.},

Conversely, interpretations for which the wavefunction is real evade such restrictions despite remaining subject to long-standing criticism regarding physical discontinuity, indeterminism and the ambiguity of the Heisenberg cut. This revives the possibility of a no-go theorem with no additional assumptions, and demonstrates that what is usually thought of as a strength of epistemic interpretations may in fact be a weakness.},

Such epidemics are described by \$2\^n\$- or \$3\^n\$-state Markov chains. Ostensibly, because analyzing such Markov chains is too complicated, their \$O(n)\$-dimensional nonlinear "mean-field" approximation, and its linearization, are often studied instead. We provide a complete global analysis of the epidemic dynamics of the nonlinear mean-field approximation. In particular, we show that depending on the largest eigenvalue of the underlying graph adjacency matrix and the rates of infection, recovery, and vaccination, the global dynamics takes on one of two forms: either the epidemic dies out, or it converges to another unique fixed point (the so-called endemic state where a constant fraction of the nodes remain infected). A similar result has also been shown in the continuous-time case. We tie in these results with the "true" underlying Markov chain model by showing that the linear model is the tightest upper-bound on the true probabilities of infection that involves only marginals, and that, even though the nonlinear model is not an upper-bound on the true probabilities in general, it does provide an upper-bound on the probability of the chain not being absorbed. As a consequence, we also show that when the disease-free fixed point is globally stable for the mean-field model, the Markov chain has an \$O(\textbackslash log n)\$ mixing time, which means the epidemic dies out quickly. We compare and summarize the results on different propagation models.},

Furthermore, students appear to prefer schools that are close to their home and schools where many of their former classmates in primary school go to.}

Its use in model organisms such as rodents, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans is now well-established. However, application of this technology in nonhuman primates (NHPs) has been slow to develop. One key challenge has been the delivery of viruses and light to the brain through the thick dura mater of NHPs, which can only be penetrated with large-diameter devices that damage the brain. The opacity of the NHP dura prevents visualization of the underlying cortex, limiting the spatial precision of virus injections, electrophysiological recordings, and photostimulation. Here, we describe a new optogenetics approach in which the native dura is replaced with an optically transparent artificial dura. This artificial dura can be penetrated with fine glass micropipettes, enabling precisely targeted injections of virus into brain tissue with minimal damage to cortex. The expression of optogenetic agents can be monitored visually over time. Most critically, this optical window permits targeted, noninvasive photostimulation and concomitant measurements of neuronal activity via intrinsic signal imaging and electrophysiological recordings. We present results from both anesthetized-paralyzed (optical imaging) and awake-behaving NHPs (electrophysiology). The improvements over current methods made possible by the artificial dura should enable the widespread use of optogenetic tools in NHP research, a key step toward the development of therapies for neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases in humans},

  abstract = {Measures of information transfer have become a popular approach to analyze interactions in complex systems such as the Earth or the human brain from measured time series. Recent work has focused on causal definitions of information transfer aimed at decompositions of predictive information about a target variable, while excluding effects of common drivers and indirect influences. While common drivers clearly constitute a spurious causality, the aim of the present article is to develop measures quantifying different notions of the strength of information transfer along indirect causal paths, based on first reconstructing the multivariate causal network. Another class of novel measures quantifies to what extent different intermediate processes on causal paths contribute to an interaction mechanism to determine pathways of causal information transfer. The proposed framework complements predictive decomposition schemes by focusing more on the interaction mechanism between multiple processes. A rigorous mathematical framework allows for a clear information-theoretic interpretation that can also be related to the underlying dynamics as proven for certain classes of processes. Generally, however, estimates of information transfer remain hard to interpret for nonlinearly intertwined complex systems. But if experiments or mathematical models are not available, then measuring pathways of information transfer within the causal dependency structure allows at least for an abstraction of the dynamics. The measures are illustrated on a climatological example to disentangle pathways of atmospheric flow over Europe.},

Beyond inferring directionality between two time series, the goal of causal network reconstruction or causal discovery is to distinguish direct from indirect dependencies and common drivers among multiple time series. Here, the problem of inferring causal networks including time lags from multivariate time series is recapitulated from the underlying causal assumptions to practical estimation problems. Each aspect is illustrated with simple examples including unobserved variables, sampling issues, determinism, stationarity, nonlinearity, measurement error, and significance testing. The effects of dynamical noise, autocorrelation, and high dimensionality are highlighted in comparison studies of common causal reconstruction methods. Finally, method performance evaluation approaches and criteria are suggested. The article is intended to briefly review and accessibly illustrate the foundations and practical problems of time series-based causal discovery and stimulate further methodological developments.}

  abstract = {For over two decades Wesley Salmon has helped to shape the course of debate in philosophy of science. He is a major contributor to the philosophical discussion of problems associated with causality and the author of two influential books on scientific explanation. This long-awaited volume collects twenty- six of Salmon's essays, including seven that have never before been published and others difficult to find. Part I comprises five introductory essays that presuppose no formal training in philosophy of science and form a background for subsequent essays. Parts \{II\} and \{III\} contain Salmon's seminal work on scientific explanation and causality. Part \{IV\} offers survey articles that feature advanced material but remain accessible to those outside philosophy of science. Essays in Part V address specific issues in particular scientific disciplines, namely, archaeology and anthropology, astrophysics and cosmology, and physics. Clear, compelling, and essential, this volume offers a superb introduction to philosophy of science for nonspecialists and belongs on the bookshelf of all who carry out work in this exciting field. Wesley Salmon is renowned for his seminal contributions to the philosophy of science. He has powerfully and permanently shaped discussion of such issues as lawlike and probabilistic explanation and the interrelation of explanatory notions to causal notions. This unique volume brings together twenty-six of his essays on subjects related to causality and explanation, written over the period 1971-1995. Six of the essays have never been published before and many others have only appeared in obscure venues. The volume includes a section of accessible introductory pieces, as well as more advanced and technical pieces, and will make essential work in the philosophy of science readily available to both scholars and students.}

In this framework, functional interactions between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex mediate emotional influences on cognitive processes such as decision-making, as well as the cognitive regulation of emotion. However, neurons in these structures often have entangled representations, whereby single neurons encode multiple cognitive and emotional variables. Here we review studies using anatomical, lesion, and neurophysiological approaches to investigate the representation and utilization of cognitive and emotional parameters. We propose that these mental state parameters are inextricably linked and represented in dynamic neural networks composed of interconnected prefrontal and limbic brain structures. Future theoretical and experimental work is required to understand how these mental state representations form and how shifts between mental states occur, a critical feature of adaptive cognitive and emotional behavior.},

Adeno-associated virus type 9 (AAV9) vector has been reported as a good candidate for intravascular gene delivery, but low levels of preexisting antibody titers against AAV in the blood abrogate cellular transduction within the CNS. In the present study we compared the effectiveness of vascular delivery and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) delivery of AAV9 in transducing CNS tissue in nonhuman primates. Both delivery routes generated similar distribution patterns, although we observed a more robust level of transduction after CSF delivery. Consistent with previous reports administering AAV9, we found greater astrocytic than neuronal tropism via both routes, although we did find a greater magnitude of CNS transduction after CSF delivery compared with intravascular delivery. Last, we have demonstrated that delivery of AAV9 into the CSF does not shield against AAV antibodies. This has obvious implications when developing and/or implementing any clinical trial studies.},

We previously showed in rats that transduction of antigen-presenting cells (APC) by AAV9 encoding a foreign protein triggered a full neurotoxic immune response. Accordingly, we asked whether this phenomenon occurred in NHP. We performed parenchymal or intrathecal infusion of AAV9 encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP), a non-self protein derived from jellyfish, or human aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (hAADC), a self-protein, in separate NHP. Animals receiving AAV9-GFP into cisterna magna (CM) became ataxic, indicating cerebellar pathology, whereas AAV9-hAADC animals remained healthy. In transduced regions, AAV9-GFP elicited inflammation associated with early activation of astrocytic and microglial cells, along with upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) in glia. In addition, we found Purkinje neurons lacking calbindin after AAV9-GFP but not after AAV9-hAADC delivery. Our results demonstrate that AAV9-mediated expression of a foreign-protein, but not self-recognized protein, triggers complete immune responses in NHP regardless of the route of administration. Our results warrant caution when contemplating use of serotypes that can transduce APC if the transgene is not syngeneic with the host. This finding has the potential to complicate preclinical toxicology studies in which such vectors encoding human cDNA's are tested in animals.},

This slow oscillation seems to be initiated in layer 5 as an excitatory interaction between pyramidal neurons and propagates through the neocortex. Our results demonstrate that the cerebral cortex generates an 'up' or depolarized state through recurrent excitation that is regulated by inhibitory networks, thereby allowing local cortical circuits to enter into temporarily activated and self-maintained excitatory states. The spontaneous generation and failure of this self-excited state may account for the generation of a subset of cortical rhythms during sleep.},

Novel approaches for brain network analysis have shown an association between topological properties and cognitive functioning. Under the assumption that "stronger is better", the exploration of brain properties has generally focused on the connectivity patterns of the most strongly correlated regions, whereas the role of weaker brain connections has remained obscure for years. Here, we assessed whether the different strength of connections between brain regions may explain individual differences in intelligence. We analyzed-functional connectivity at rest in ninety-eight healthy individuals of different age, and correlated several connectivity measures with full scale, verbal, and performance Intelligent Quotients (IQs). Our results showed that the variance in IQ levels was mostly explained by the distributed communication efficiency of brain networks built using moderately weak, long-distance connections, with only a smaller contribution of stronger connections. The variability in individual IQs was associated with the global efficiency of a pool of regions in the prefrontal lobes, hippocampus, temporal pole, and postcentral gyrus. These findings challenge the traditional view of a prominent role of strong functional brain connections in brain topology, and highlight the importance of both strong and weak connections in determining the functional architecture responsible for human intelligence variability.

Starting from the observation that each entity plays a more or less important role in transmitting the information inside a network, the objective of this article is to propose a method which exploits the role played by a given node to both estimate the impact of its disappearance on the information flow, and conduct network changes to restore the information flow with a similar quality as before the node disappearance. To this end, we propose a network restructuring approach that categorizes nodes into critical and non-critical classes based on their role, and hence, manages their disappearance appropriately by adding new links in a parsimonious way and selecting a substitute for a deleted critical node. As opposed to a previously defined solution, our approach adds links that are just enough to maintain the quality of the information flow within the network as before a node deletion. A prototype is designed and implemented using an open source social network analysis library (NetworkX). Its validation is conducted using network data sets with various sizes. The empirical study shows a low network update, a quite constant quality of the information flow and reasonable execution times after a node deletion.},

An entity can be observed with or without a scope. In the second case, the observation is a purely non-invasive discovery process; in the first case, it is a purely invasive process, which can involve either creation or destruction aspects. An entity can also be observed with or without a full control over the observational process. In the latter case, the observation can be described by a symmetry breaking mechanism, through which a specific deterministic observational process is selected among a number of potential ones, as explained in Aerts' hidden measurement approach. This is what is called a product test, or product observation, whose consequences are that outcomes can only be predicted in probabilistic terms, as it is the case in typical quantum measurements. We also show that observations can be about intrinsic (stable) properties of the observed entity, or about relational (ephemeral) properties between the observer and observed entities; also, they can be about intermediate properties, neither purely classical, nor purely quantum. Our analysis allows us to propose a general conceptual characterization of quantum measurements, as observational processes involving three aspects: (1) product observations, (2) pure creation aspects and (3) ephemeral relational properties. We also discuss the important concept of non-spatiality and emphasize some of the differences and similarities between quantum and classical/relativistic observations. \textcopyright{} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

An application to rock-scissors-paper game interactions shows that the collective learning dynamics exhibits a diversity of competitive and cooperative behaviors.

We here present IT measures of direct, indirect, and total causal effects. The proposed measures are unlike existing IT techniques in that they enable measuring causal effects that are defined with respect to specific values of a cause while still offering the flexibility and general applicability of IT techniques.

  abstract = {Methods of spatio-temporal analysis provide important tools for characterizing several dynamic aspects of brain oscillations that are reflected in the human scalp-detected electroencephalogram (EEG). The search to identify the dynamic connectivity of brain signals within different frequency bands, in order to uncover the transient cooperation between different brain sites, converges at the potential of multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) models and their derived parameters. In fact, MVAR parameters provide a whole battery of so-called coupling measures including classic coherence (COH), partial coherence (pCOH), imaginary part of coherence (iCOH), partial-directed coherence (PDC), directed transfer function (DTF), and full frequency directed transfer function (ffDTF). All of these approaches have been developed to quantify the degree of coupling between different EEG recording positions, with the specific aim to characterize the functional interaction between neural populations within the cortex. This work addresses the application of MVAR models to event-related brain processes, including different statistical approaches, and reviews most relevant findings in the expanding field of coupling analysis. Finally, we present several examples of coupling patterns associated with certain types of movement imagery.},

  abstract = {An important question in neuroscience is how the structure and dynamics of a neuronal network relate to each other. We approach this problem by modeling the spiking activity of large-scale neuronal networks that exhibit several complex network properties. Our main focus lies on the relevance of two particular attributes for the dynamics, namely structural heterogeneity and degree correlations. As a central result, we introduce a novel mean-field method that makes it possible to calculate the average activity of heterogeneous, degree-correlated neuronal networks without having to simulate each neuron explicitly. We find that the connectivity structure is sufficiently captured by a reduced matrix that contains only the coupling between the populations. With the mean-field method and numerical simulations we demonstrate that assortative degree correlations enhance the network's ability to sustain activity for low external excitation, thus making it more sensitive to small input signals.},

  abstract = {Purpose Optogenetic fMRI (ofMRI) is a novel tool in neurophysiology and neuroimaging. The method is prone to light-induced artifacts, two of which were investigated in this study. Methods ofMRI was performed in rats using two excitatory opsins (ChR2 and C1V1TT) virally transduced in somatosensory cortex or thalamus. Heat-induced apparent BOLD activation at the site of the optical fiber and stimulation light\textendash induced activation of the visual pathways were investigated, and control experiments for these two artifacts were established. Results Specific optogenetic BOLD activation was observed with both opsins, accompanied by BOLD in the visual pathways. Unspecific heat-induced BOLD was ruled out by a control experiment employing low-level constant illumination in addition to pulsed optogenetic stimulation. Activation of the visual pathways was confirmed to be physiological by direct visual stimulation of the eyes and was suppressed by additional low-level constant light to the eyes. Light inside the brain was identified as one source of the BOLD signal observed in the visual pathways. Conclusion ofMRI is a method of tremendous potential, but unspecific activations in fMRI not caused by the activation of opsins must be avoided or recognized as such. The control experiments presented here allow for validating the specificity of optogenetic stimulation. Magn Reson Med, 2016. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We advocate a third interpretation, in which attributes are conceptualized as systems of causally coupled (observable) variables. In such a view, a construct like 'depression' is not seen as a latent variable that underlies symptoms like 'lack of sleep' or 'fatigue', and neither as a composite constructed out of these symptoms, but as a system of causal relations between the symptoms themselves (e.g., lack of sleep \textrightarrow{} fatigue, etc.). We discuss methodological strategies to investigate such systems as well as theoretical consequences that bear on the question in which sense such a construct could be interpreted as real. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Binocular depth inversion represents an illusion of visual perception, serving to invert the perception of implausible hollow objects, e.g. a hollow face into a normal face. Such inversion occurs frequently, especially when objects with a high degree of familiarity (e.g. photographs of faces) are displayed. Under normal conditions, cognitive factors apparently override the binocular disparity cues of stereopsis. This internal mechanism--a kind of "censorship" of perception balancing "top-down" and "bottom-up" processes of perception--appears to be disturbed in psychotic states. The clinical and neuropsychological performance of schizophrenic patients was assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), the Mehrfach-Wahlwortschatz Intelligence Test (MWT-B) and the binocular depth inversion test (BDIT) using pictures with a high degree of familiarity. In schizophrenic patients, the performance in the BDIT differed significantly from healthy controls and from patients with major depression. The schizophrenic patients were more veridical in their judgements in the BDIT. During antipsychotic treatment, BPRS and PANSS scores improved and the inversed faces were seen as more illusionary, driven by an increase in top-down processing. At the end of treatment, there was no significant difference between the patient group and the healthy controls in the score of binocular depth inversion. These findings suggest that testing of binocular depth inversion can detect specific dysfunctions in visual perception and might be useful as a state-marker for psychotic states.},

Non-Markovian characteristics resulting from the ordering of interactions in temporal networks were identified as one important mechanism that alters causality, and affects dynamical processes. So far, an analytical explanation for this phenomenon and for the significant variations observed across different systems is missing. Here we introduce a methodology that allows to analytically predict causality-driven changes of diffusion speed in non-Markovian temporal networks. Validating our predictions in six data sets, we show that - compared to the time-aggregated network - non-Markovian characteristics can lead to both a slow-down, or speed-up of diffusion which can even outweigh the decelerating effect of community structures in the static topology. Thus, non-Markovian properties of temporal networks constitute an important additional dimension of complexity in time-varying complex systems.},

In this study, we examined whether stress and corticosteroids are capable of facilitating the switch between multiple memory systems in mice. For this purpose, we designed a task that allowed measurement of nucleus caudate-based stimulus-response and hippocampus-based spatial learning strategies. Naive mice used spatial strategies to locate an exit hole on a circular hole board at a fixed location flagged by a proximal stimulus. When the mice were either stressed or administered corticosterone before the task, 30-50\% of the mice switched to a stimulus-response strategy. This switch between learning strategies was accompanied by a rescue of performance, whereas performance declined in the stressed mice that kept using the spatial strategy. Pretreatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist prevented the switch toward the stimulus-response strategy but led to deterioration of hippocampus-dependent performance. These findings (i) show that corticosteroids promote the transition from spatial to stimulus-response memory systems, (ii) provide evidence that the mineralocorticoid receptor underlies this corticosteroid-mediated switch, and (iii) suggest that a stress-induced switch from hippocampus-based to nucleus caudate-based memory systems can rescue performance.},

Whether this is due to a facilitating effect of stress on stimulus-response learning, an impairing effect on spatial learning, or both, is not known. To answer this question, mice were either subjected to restraint stress, injected with vehicle or corticosterone or left untreated before training in two circular hole board tasks that could discriminate spatial and stimulus-response strategies. Stress, vehicle and corticosterone injection all impaired learning performance in the spatial task. Conversely, performance in the stimulus-response task was not affected by stress or corticosterone injection, although performance was generally lower than in the spatial task. Irrespective of the treatment, mice had to overcome the preference to use their spatial memory system to achieve the stimulus-response task. These findings suggest that (i) the caudate nucleus-based memory system is less stress sensitive than the hippocampus-based system and may thus dominate behavior in situations of stress and (ii) that multiple memory systems may compete for control of behavior even in tasks that can solely be solved by one system.},

In medium spiny neurons (MSNs) from mice expressing human mutant torsinA (hMT), we observed a significantly higher frequency, but not amplitude, of GABAergic spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) and miniature currents (mIPSCs), whereas glutamate-dependent spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents (sEPSCs) were normal. No alterations were found in mice overexpressing normal human torsinA (hWT). To identify the possible sources of the increased GABAergic tone, we recorded GABAergic Fast-Spiking (FS) interneurons that exert a feed-forward inhibition on MSNs. However, both sEPSC and sIPSC recorded from hMT FS interneurons were comparable to hWT and non-transgenic (NT) mice. In physiological conditions, dopamine (DA) D2 receptor act presynaptically to reduce striatal GABA release. Of note, application of the D2-like receptor agonist quinpirole failed to reduce the frequency of sIPSCs in MSNs from hMT as compared to hWT and NT mice. Likewise, the inhibitory effect of quinpirole was lost on evoked IPSCs both in MSNs and FS interneurons from hMT mice. Our findings demonstrate a disinhibition of striatal GABAergic synaptic activity, that can be at least partially attributed to a D2 DA receptor dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Measuring the impacts of invasive species on recipient biotic communities can be challenging because standard ecological field experiments may be impossible, undesirable or inaccurate due to limitations of scale. Many studies therefore rely on a comparative observational approach, in which invaded areas are compared to similar nearby uninvaded areas, but this approach suffers from reduced inferential power because of the inability to randomly assign treatments. When possible, the best solution may be to incorporate comparative sampling over time, from before and after invasion, as a means of validating comparisons across space. We used this approach to assess the impacts of Argentine and big-headed ants on arthropod communities at two natural area sites in the Hawaiian Islands. Two sampling events, separated by 2 years, indicated that invaded plots at each site were significantly different from uninvaded plots in terms of overall community composition and distributions of certain indicator species. This compositional change associated with ant invasion was accompanied by a significant decrease in arthropod species richness at one site, but not at the second site. Changes in arthropod communities from before invasion to after invasion in separate before-after plots at each site were qualitatively consistent with the aforementioned changes measured across the invasion boundaries, but were smaller in magnitude because the invasion processes were still in early stages. Together, these findings support the inference that carefully planned studies of biological invasions that use a comparative observational approach can provide an accurate picture of resultant community level changes, and illustrate an effective method for validating such studies.},

Most de novo CNVs were smaller than microscopic resolution. Affected genomic regions were highly heterogeneous and included mutations of single genes.

It is generally assumed in the literature and in computational and theoretical models of working memory that memory-cell activity is stable and replicable; however, this assumption may be an artifact of the averaging of data collected across trials, and needs experimental verification. In this study, we introduce a classification scheme to characterize the firing frequency trends of cells recorded from the cortex of monkeys during performance of working memory tasks. We examine the frequency statistics and variability of firing during baseline and memory periods. We also study the behavior of cells on individual trials and across trials, and explore the stability of cellular firing during the memory period. We find that cells from different firing-trend classes possess markedly different statistics. We also find that individual cells show substantial variability in their firing behavior across trials, and that firing frequency also varies markedly over the course of a single trial. Finally, the average frequency distribution is wider, the magnitude of the frequency increases from baseline to memory smaller, and the magnitude of frequency decreases larger than is generally assumed. These results may serve as a guide in the evaluation of current theories of the cortical mechanisms of working memory.},

Although old age is often stereotyped as a time of declining mental abilities and inflexibility, cognitive neuroscience reveals that older adults use neural and cognitive resources flexibly, recruiting novel neural regions and cognitive processes when necessary. Our aim in this project is to understand how age-related changes to neural structure and function interact to support cognitive abilities across the lifespan.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS/DESIGN: We are recruiting a population-based cohort of 3000 adults aged 18 and over into Stage 1 of the project, where they complete an interview including health and lifestyle questions, a core cognitive assessment, and a self-completed questionnaire of lifetime experiences and physical activity. Of those interviewed, 700 participants aged 18-87 (100 per age decile) continue to Stage 2 where they undergo cognitive testing and provide measures of brain structure and function. Cognition is assessed across multiple domains including attention and executive control, language, memory, emotion, action control and learning. A subset of 280 adults return for in-depth neurocognitive assessment in Stage 3, using functional neuroimaging experiments across our key cognitive domains.Formal statistical models will be used to examine the changes that occur with healthy ageing, and to evaluate age-related reorganisation in terms of cognitive and neural functions invoked to compensate for overall age-related brain structural decline. Taken together the three stages provide deep phenotyping that will allow us to measure neural activity and flexibility during performance across a number of core cognitive functions. This approach offers hypothesis-driven insights into the relationship between brain and behaviour in healthy ageing that are relevant to the general population.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nDISCUSSION: Our study is a unique resource of neuroimaging and cognitive measures relevant to change across the adult lifespan. Because we focus on normal age-related changes, our results may contribute to changing views about the ageing process, lead to targeted interventions, and reveal how normal ageing relates to frail ageing in clinicopathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.},

We precisely define this complexity for spatially-extended dynamical systems, using the probabilistic ideas of mutual information and minimal sufficient statistics. This leads to a general method for predicting such systems, and a simple algorithm for estimating statistical complexity. The results of applying this algorithm to a class of models of excitable media (cyclic cellular automata) strongly support our proposal.},

  abstract = {The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

It has been implicated in a diversity of functions, from reward processing and performance monitoring to the execution of control and action selection. Here, we propose that this diversity can be understood in terms of a single underlying function: allocation of control based on an evaluation of the expected value of control (EVC). We present a normative model of EVC that integrates three critical factors: the expected payoff from a controlled process, the amount of control that must be invested to achieve that payoff, and the cost in terms of cognitive effort. We propose that dACC integrates this information, using it to determine whether, where and how much control to allocate. We then consider how the EVC model can explain the diverse array of findings concerning dACC function},

  abstract = {With recent socio-economic developments the number of crime offences has risen drastically and the demographic factors are strongly cited as determinant of crime rate. In such scenario crime events usually related with a variety of crime socio-economic opportunity factors and hence the traditional system of criminal records has failed to maintain the required level of intelligence and predictive trends. In such irresolute environment the existing literature on crime prediction suggests to blend crime events with spatial-temporal analysis and use Generalized Linear Model for identification of the patterns within a criminal site selection criterion. Such model may improve quantitative prediction even during the temporal changes of criminals may transpires for certain sites. In this paper we enhance the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) for Crime Site Selection (CSS) and examine it for crime events using regression in association with big data technologies. This novel approach is based on standard deviation and autoregressive vector node has been proposed to find similar crime trends among various crime locations for criminal site selection and subsequently use this information for future crime trends prediction. This analysis presents a more significant insight into the scope and complexion of crime prediction with improved certainty.},

We find that such bistability is also present in an Ising model in which the transition probabilities are expressed in terms of Boltzmann factors depending only on the nearest-neighbor spins and the associated bond strengths. The strength on each bond assumes different values with respect to the spins at either of its ends, introducing an asymmetry like that of the Toom model. \textcopyright{} 1992 The American Physical Society.}

  abstract = {Based on the conceptual basis of information theory, we propose a novel mutual information measure\textemdash `path-based mutual information'. This information measure results from the representation of a set of random variables as a probabilistic graphical model. The edges in this graph are modeled as discrete memoryless communication channels, that is, the underlying data is ergodic, stationary, and the Markov condition is assumed to be applicable. The associated multilinear stochastic maps, tensors, transform source probability mass functions into destination probability mass functions. This allows for an exact expression of the resulting tensor of a cascade of discrete memoryless communication channels in terms of the tensors of the constituting communication channels in the paths. The resulting path-based information measure gives rise to intuitive, non-negative, and additive path-based information components\textemdash redundant, unique, and synergistic information\textemdash as proposed by Williams and Beer. The path-based redundancy satisfies the axioms postulated by Williams and Beer, the identity axiom postulated by Harder, and the left monotonicity axiom postulated Bertschinger. The ordering relations between redundancies of different joint collections of sources, as captured in the redundancy lattices of Williams and Beer, follow from the data processing inequality. Although negative information components can arise, we speculate that these either result from unobserved variables, or from adding additional sources that are statistically independent from all other sources to a system containing only non-negative information components. This path-based approach illustrates that information theory provides the concepts and measures for a partial information decomposition.},

  abstract = {In the study of disease spreading on empirical complex networks in SIR model, initially infected nodes can be ranked according to some measure of their epidemic impact. The highest ranked nodes, also referred to as "superspreaders", are associated to dominant epidemic risks and therefore deserve special attention. In simulations on studied empirical complex networks, it is shown that the ranking depends on the dynamical regime of the disease spreading. A possible mechanism leading to this dependence is illustrated in an analytically tractable example. In systems where the allocation of resources to counter disease spreading to individual nodes is based on their ranking, the dynamical regime of disease spreading is frequently not known before the outbreak of the disease. Therefore, we introduce a quantity called epidemic centrality as an average over all relevant regimes of disease spreading as a basis of the ranking. A recently introduced concept of phase diagram of epidemic spreading is used as a framework in which several types of averaging are studied. The epidemic centrality is compared to structural properties of nodes such as node degree, k-cores and betweenness. There is a growing trend of epidemic centrality with degree and k-cores values, but the variation of epidemic centrality is much smaller than the variation of degree or k-cores value. It is found that the epidemic centrality of the structurally peripheral nodes is of the same order of magnitude as the epidemic centrality of the structurally central nodes. The implications of these findings for the distributions of resources to counter disease spreading are discussed.},

First, the fundamental interdependence among brain, body, and niche makes it possible to explain extended cognition without invoking representations or computation. Second, cognition and conscious experience can be understood as a single phenomenon, eliminating fruitless philosophical discussion of qualia and the so-called hard problem of consciousness.

However, while ABM has been used occasionally in population health, we argue that for ABM to be most effective in the field it should be used as a means for answering questions normally inaccessible to the traditional epidemiological toolkit. In an effort to clearly illustrate the utility of ABM for population health research, and to clear up persistent misunderstandings regarding the method's conceptual underpinnings, we offer a detailed presentation of the core concepts of complex systems theory, and summarise why simulations are essential to the study of complex systems. We then examine the current state of the art in ABM for population health, and propose they are well-suited for the study of the `wicked' problems in population health, and could make significant contributions to theory and intervention development in these areas.},

This characterization is typically achieved by measuring the correlation in the activity of two neurons. We have developed a new measure for studying connectivity in neuronal circuits based on information theory, the incremental mutual information (IMI). By conditioning out the temporal dependencies in the responses of individual neurons before measuring the dependency between them, IMI improves on standard correlation-based measures in several important ways: 1) it has the potential to disambiguate statistical dependencies that reflect the connection between neurons from those caused by other sources (e.g. shared inputs or intrinsic cellular or network mechanisms) provided that the dependencies have appropriate timescales, 2) for the study of early sensory systems, it does not require responses to repeated trials of identical stimulation, and 3) it does not assume that the connection between neurons is linear. We describe the theory and implementation of IMI in detail and demonstrate its utility on experimental recordings from the primate visual system.},

  abstract = {As the title says we want to answer the question; how and why does statistical mechanics work? As we know from the most used prescription of Gibbs we calculate the phase space averages of dynamical quantities and we find that these phase averages agree very well with experiments. Clearly actual experiments are not done on a hypothetical ensemble they are done on the actual system in the laboratory and these experiments take a finite amount of time. Thus it is usually argued that actual measurements are time averages and they are equal to phase averages due to ergodicity. Aim of the present review is to show that ergodicity is not relevant for equilibrium statistical mechanics (with Tolman and Landau). We will see that the solution of the problem is in the very peculiar nature of the macroscopic observables and with the very large number of the degrees of freedom involved in macroscopic systems as first pointed out by Khinchin. Similar arguments are used by Landau based upon the approximate property of "Statistical Independence". We review these ideas in detail and in some cases present a critique. We review the role of chaos (classical and quantum) where it is important and where it is not important. We criticise the ideas of E. T. Jaynes who says that the ergodic problem is conceptual one and is related to the very concept of ensemble itself which is a by-product of frequency theory of probability, and the ergodic problem becomes irrelevant when the probabilities of various micro-states are interpreted with Laplace-Bernoulli theory of Probability (Bayesian viewpoint). In the end we critically review various quantum approaches (quantum-statistical typicality approaches) to the foundations of statistical mechanics.},

  abstract = {We study models of opinion formation on static as well as dynamic networks where interaction among individuals is governed by widely accepted social theories. In particular, three models of competing opinions based on distinct interaction mechanisms are studied. A common feature in all of these models is the existence of a tipping point in terms of a model parameter beyond which a rapid consensus is reached. In the first model that we study on a static network, a node adopts a particular state (opinion) if a threshold fraction of its neighbors are already in that state. We introduce a few initiator nodes which are in state '1' in a population where every node is in state '0'. Thus, opinion '1' spreads through the population until no further influence is possible. Size of the spread is greatly affected by how these initiator nodes are selected. We find that there exists a critical fraction of initiators pc that is needed to trigger global cascades for a given threshold [phi]. We also study heuristic strategies for selecting a set of initiator nodes in order to maximize the cascade size. The structural properties of networks also play an important role in the spreading process. We study how the dynamics is affected by changing the clustering in a network. It turns out that local clustering is helpful in spreading. Next, we studied a model where the network is dynamic and interactions are homophilic. We find that homophily-driven rewiring impedes the reaching of consensus and in the absence of committed nodes (nodes that are not influenceable on their opinion), consensus time Tc diverges exponentially with network size N . As we introduce a fraction of committed nodes, beyond a critical value, the scaling of Tc becomes logarithmic in N . We also find that slight change in the interaction rule can produce strikingly different scaling behaviors of T c . However, introducing committed agents in the system drastically improves the scaling of the consensus time regardless of the interaction rules considered. Finally, a three-state (leftist, rightist, centrist) model that couples the dynamics of social balance with an external deradicalizing field is studied. The mean-field analysis shows that for a weak external field, the system exhibits a metastable fixed point and a saddle point in addition to a stable fixed point. However, if the strength of the external field is sufficiently large (larger than a critical value), there is only one (stable) fixed point which corresponds to an all-centrist consensus state (absorbing state). In the weak-field regime, the convergence time to the absorbing state is evaluated using the quasi-stationary(QS) distribution and is found to be in good agreement with the results obtained by numerical simulations.},

This review examines critically a selection of the literature on how physical space affects the formation of social ties. Different aspects of this question have been a feature in network analysis, neighborhood research, geography, organizational science, architecture and design, and urban planning. Focusing primarily on work at the meso- and microlevels of analysis, we pay special attention to studies examining spatial processes in neighborhood and organizational contexts. We argue that spatial context plays a role in the formation of social ties through at least three mechanisms, spatial propinquity, spatial composition, and spatial configuration; that fully capturing the role of spatial context will require multiple disciplinary perspectives and both qualitative and quantitative research; and that both methodological and conceptual questions central to the role of space in networks remain to be answered. We conclude by identifying major challenges in this work and proposing areas for future research.},

The boundaries of the visual areas were determined by retinotopic mapping procedures and were visualized on flattened representations of the occipital cortex. Estimates of receptive field size were derived from the temporal duration of the functional activation at each cortical location as a visual stimulus passed through the receptive fields represented at that location. Receptive fields are smallest in the primary visual cortex (V1). They are larger in V2, larger again in V3/VP and largest of all in areas V3A and V4. In all these areas, receptive fields increase in size with increasing stimulus eccentricity. The results are qualitatively in line with those obtained by others in macaque monkeys using neurophysiological methods.},

We probed these temporal characteristics of habitual behaviors by intervening optogenetically in forebrain habit circuits as rats performed well-ingrained habitual runs in a T-maze. We trained rats to perform a maze habit, confirmed the habitual behavior by devaluation tests, and then, during the maze runs (ca. 3 s), we disrupted population activity in a small region in the medial prefrontal cortex, the infralimbic cortex. In accordance with evidence that this region is necessary for the expression of habits, we found that this cortical disruption blocked habitual behavior. Notably, however, this blockade of habitual performance occurred on line, within an average of three trials (ca. 9 s of inhibition), and as soon as during the first trial ({$<$}3 s). During subsequent weeks of training, the rats acquired a new behavioral pattern. When we again imposed the same cortical perturbation, the rats regained the suppressed maze-running that typified the original habit, and, simultaneously, the more recently acquired habit was blocked. These online changes occurred within an average of two trials (ca. 6 s of infralimbic inhibition). Measured changes in generalized performance ability and motivation to consume reward were unaffected. This immediate toggling between breaking old habits and returning to them demonstrates that even semiautomatic behaviors are under cortical control and that this control occurs online, second by second. These temporal characteristics define a framework for uncovering cellular transitions between fixed and flexible behaviors, and corresponding disturbances in pathologies.},

  abstract = {Stochastic actor-based models are models for network dynamics that can represent a wide variety of influences on network change, and allow to estimate parameters expressing such influences, and test corresponding hypotheses. The nodes in the network represent social actors, and the collection of ties represents a social relation. The assumptions posit that the network evolves as a stochastic process `driven by the actors', i.e., the model lends itself especially for representing theories about how actors change their outgoing ties. The probabilities of tie changes are in part endogenously determined, i.e., as a function of the current network structure itself, and in part exogenously, as a function of characteristics of the nodes (`actor covariates') and of characteristics of pairs of nodes (`dyadic covariates'). In an extended form, stochastic actor-based models can be used to analyze longitudinal data on social networks jointly with changing attributes of the actors: dynamics of networks and behavior. This paper gives an introduction to stochastic actor-based models for dynamics of directed networks, using only a minimum of mathematics. The focus is on understanding the basic principles of the model, understanding the results, and on sensible rules for model selection.},

These use the same approach of a continuous-time Markov chain observed at a small number of time points, but now with an extended state space. The state space can be, for example, the combination of a network and nodal variables, or a combination of several networks. This leads to models for the dynamics of multivariate networks.

The resulting algorithm significantly suppresses the random walk behavior and wasted function evaluations that are typically the consequence of update rejection.

By using simulated annealing optimization, it is shown that optimally heterogeneous nets actually cluster around the same narrow domain, suggesting that strong constraints actually operate on the possible universe of complex networks.

The current study examined cognitive control - the ability to maintain task context online to support adaptive functioning in the face of response competition - in 22 adolescents aged 12-18 with autism spectrum disorders and 23 age, gender, and IQ matched typically developing subjects. During the cue phase of the task, where subjects must maintain information online to overcome a prepotent response tendency, typically developing subjects recruited significantly more anterior frontal (BA 10), parietal (BA 7 and BA 40), and occipital regions (BA 18) for high control trials (25\% of trials) versus low control trials (75\% of trials). Both groups showed similar activation for low control cues, however the ASD group exhibited significantly less activation for high control cues. Functional connectivity analysis using time series correlation, factor analysis, and beta series correlation methods provided convergent evidence that the ASD group exhibited lower levels of functional connectivity and less network integration between frontal, parietal, and occipital regions. In the typically developing group, fronto-parietal connectivity was related to lower error rates on high control trials. In the autism group, reduced fronto-parietal connectivity was related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.},

  abstract = {Each of our movements activates our own sensory receptors, and therefore keeping track of self-movement is a necessary part of analysing sensory input. One way in which the brain keeps track of self-movement is by monitoring an internal copy, or corollary discharge, of motor commands. This concept could explain why we perceive a stable visual world despite our frequent quick, or saccadic, eye movements: corollary discharge about each saccade would permit the visual system to ignore saccade-induced visual changes. The critical missing link has been the connection between corollary discharge and visual processing. Here we show that such a link is formed by a corollary discharge from the thalamus that targets the frontal cortex. In the thalamus, neurons in the mediodorsal nucleus relay a corollary discharge of saccades from the midbrain superior colliculus to the cortical frontal eye field. In the frontal eye field, neurons use corollary discharge to shift their visual receptive fields spatially before saccades. We tested the hypothesis that these two components-a pathway for corollary discharge and neurons with shifting receptive fields-form a circuit in which the corollary discharge drives the shift. First we showed that the known spatial and temporal properties of the corollary discharge predict the dynamic changes in spatial visual processing of cortical neurons when saccades are made. Then we moved from this correlation to causation by isolating single cortical neurons and showing that their spatial visual processing is impaired when corollary discharge from the thalamus is interrupted. Thus the visual processing of frontal neurons is spatiotemporally matched with, and functionally dependent on, corollary discharge input from the thalamus. These experiments establish the first link between corollary discharge and visual processing, delineate a brain circuit that is well suited for mediating visual stability, and provide a framework for studying corollary discharge in other sensory systems},

Recent methods based on information theoretic measures such as Transfer Entropy (TE) made significant progress on this issue by providing a model-free framework for causality detection. However, TE estimation from observed data is not a trivial task, especially when the number of variables is large which is the case in a highly complex system like human brain. Here we propose a computationally efficient procedure for TE estimation based on using sets of the Most Informative Variables that effectively contribute to resolving the uncertainty of the destination. In the first step of this method, some conditioning sets are determined through a nonlinear state space reconstruction; then in the second step, optimal estimation of TE is done based on these sets. Validation of the proposed method using synthetic data and neurophysiological signals demonstrates computational efficiency in quantifying delayed directional couplings compared with the common TE analysis.},

To analyze these constraints we have examined the relationship between structural features of networks (expressed as graphs) and the patterns of functional connectivity to which they give rise when implemented as dynamical systems. We selected among structurally varying graphs using as selective criteria a number of global information-theoretical measures that characterize functional connectivity. We selected graphs separately for increases in measures of entropy (capturing statistical independence of graph elements), integration (capturing their statistical dependence) and complexity (capturing the interplay between their functional segregation and integration). We found that dynamics with high complexity were supported by graphs whose units were organized into densely linked groups that were sparsely and reciprocally interconnected. Connection matrices based on actual neuroanatomical data describing areas and pathways of the macaque visual cortex and the cat cortex showed structural characteristics that coincided best with those of such complex graphs, revealing the presence of distinct but interconnected anatomical groupings of areas. Moreover, when implemented as dynamical systems, these cortical connection matrices generated functional connectivity with high complexity, characterized by the presence of highly coherent functional clusters. We also found that selection of graphs as they responded to input or produced output led to increases in the complexity of their dynamics. We hypothesize that adaptation to rich sensory environments and motor demands requires complex dynamics and that these dynamics are supported by neuroanatomical motifs that are characteristic of the cerebral cortex.},

This nested interconnectivity suggests the hypothesis that cortical connections are arranged in fractal or self-similar patterns. We describe a simple procedure to generate fractal connection patterns that aim at capturing the potential self-similarity and hierarchical ordering of neuronal connections. We examine these connection patterns by calculating a broad range of structural measures, including small-world attributes and motif composition, as well as some global measures of functional connectivity, including complexity. As we vary fractal patterns by changing a critical control parameter, we find strongly correlated changes in several structural and functional measures, suggesting that they emerge together and are mutually linked. Measures obtained from some modeled fractal patterns closely resemble those of real neuroanatomical data sets, supporting the original hypothesis.},

It has been shown that ErrPs can be automatically detected in tasks with time-discrete feedback, which is widely applied in the field of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for error correction or adaptation. However, there are only a few studies that concentrate on ErrPs during continuous feedback. With this study, we wanted to answer three different questions: (i) Can ErrPs be measured in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during a task with continuous cursor control? (ii) Can ErrPs be classified using machine learning methods and is it possible to discriminate errors of different origins? (iii) Can we use EEG to detect the severity of an error? To answer these questions, we recorded EEG data from 10 subjects during a video game task and investigated two different types of error (execution error, due to inaccurate feedback; outcome error, due to not achieving the goal of an action). We analyzed the recorded data to show that during the same task, different kinds of error produce different ErrP waveforms and have a different spectral response. This allows us to detect and discriminate errors of different origin in an event-locked manner. By utilizing the error-related spectral response, we show that also a continuous, asynchronous detection of errors is possible. Although the detection of error severity based on EEG was one goal of this study, we did not find any significant influence of the severity on the EEG.},

  author = {Stafford, R Jason},
  abstract = {Introduction The amount of available signal in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is inextricably tied to the static magnetic field strength (B0) of the imaging system. Until recently, most clinical MRI scanners operated at field strengths at or below 1.5 Tesla, however, due in part to improvements in magnet design and shielding which ease siting requirements, 3 Tesla clinical scanners are now widely available and there is a push for even higher field whole body scanners (7-11 Tesla) throughout the industry. The drive towards high-field MRI is fueled by the benefits of potentially higher signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratios and spectral resolution for certain applications. In many cases, these benefits will facilitate higher spatial and/or temporal resolution than previously possible with MRI. There are, however, technological, physical and safety limitations inhibiting the full realization of these benefits at high-field. Technology issues include homogeneity of the B0 and B1 magnetic fields, higher gradient coil performance and linearity, and the design of robust radiofrequency array coils for signal reception. At high-field, physics concerns include changes in relaxation kinetics, increased susceptibility effects and other changes in contrast mechanisms. Safety limitations include higher power radiofrequency pulses and the potential for tissue heating or coil burns, stimulation effects from stronger, faster switching gradients and moving within a higher magnetic field and, most prominently, the potential dangers associated with the main magnetic field, such as ferromagnetic projectiles in the scan room and effects on implanted medical devices, many of which have not been evaluated at fields above 1.5 Tesla. Ultimately, the design of protocols and acquisition methods that account for these limitation will need to be pursued in order to reap the benefits of high-field MRI without compromising patient safety. Many MR imaging techniques have already seen demonstrable improvement at higher fields and have driven the development of high-field systems. Techniques in functional magnetic resonance imaging that rely on blood-oxygen level dependent contrast mechanisms, techniques in angiography and techniques in dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion imaging all benefit from the effects of higher fields on local susceptibility contrast. Proton MR spectroscopy methods for brain and body imaging benefit from the higher spectral resolution of high field as do multi-nuclear techniques. Changes in relaxation kinetics provide enhanced contrast in angiography techniques and arterial spin labeling techniques.},

  abstract = {Many complex and interesting phenomena in nature are due to nonlinear phenomena. The theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, also called 'chaos theory', has now progressed to a stage, where it becomes possible to study self-organization and pattern formation in the complex neuronal networks of the brain. One approach to nonlinear time series analysis consists of reconstructing, from time series of EEG or MEG, an attractor of the underlying dynamical system, and characterizing it in terms of its dimension (an estimate of the degrees of freedom of the system), or its Lyapunov exponents and entropy (reflecting unpredictability of the dynamics due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions). More recently developed nonlinear measures characterize other features of local brain dynamics (forecasting, time asymmetry, determinism) or the nonlinear synchronization between recordings from different brain regions. Nonlinear time series has been applied to EEG and MEG of healthy subjects during no-task resting states, perceptual processing, performance of cognitive tasks and different sleep stages. Many pathologic states have been examined as well, ranging from toxic states, seizures, and psychiatric disorders to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Cre1utzfeldt-Jakob's disease. Interpretation of these results in terms of 'functional sources' and 'functional networks' allows the identification of three basic patterns of brain dynamics: (i) normal, ongoing dynamics during a no-task, resting state in healthy subjects; this state is characterized by a high dimensional complexity and a relatively low and fluctuating level of synchronization of the neuronal networks; (ii) hypersynchronous, highly nonlinear dynamics of epileptic seizures; (iii) dynamics of degenerative encephalopathies with an abnormally low level of between area synchronization. Only intermediate levels of rapidly fluctuating synchronization, possibly due to critical dynamics near a phase transition, are associated with normal information processing, whereas both hyper-as well as hyposynchronous states result in impaired information processing and disturbed consciousness.},

Here we use optogenetics to modulate in real time electrophysiological and neurochemical properties of mesencephalic dopaminergic (mesDA) neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). In mice that had recovered from lesion-induced Parkinsonian motor deficits, light-induced selective silencing of graft activity rapidly and reversibly re-introduced the motor deficits. The re-introduction of motor deficits was prevented by the dopamine agonist apomorphine. These results suggest that functionality depends on graft neuronal activity and dopamine release. Combining optogenetics, slice electrophysiology and pharmacological approaches, we further show that mesDA-rich grafts modulate host glutamatergic synaptic transmission onto striatal medium spiny neurons in a manner reminiscent of endogenous mesDA neurons. Thus, application of optogenetics in cell therapy can link transplantation, animal behavior and postmortem analysis to enable the identification of mechanisms that drive recovery.},

Thalamocortical cells were recognized by backfiring from appropriate neocortical areas, spindle-related cyclic IPSPs, and hyperpolarization-activated delta oscillation consisting of rhythmic low-threshold spikes (LTSs) alternating with afterhyperpolarizing potentials (AHPs). The slow rhythm (0.3-0.5 Hz) was recorded in 65\% of RE neurons. In approximately 90\% of oscillating cells, the rhythm consisted of prolonged depolarizations giving rise to trains of single action potentials. DC hyperpolarization increased the synaptic noise and, in a few cells, suppressed the long-lasting depolarizing phase of the slow rhythm, without blocking the fast EPSPs. In approximately 10\% of oscillating neurons, the hyperpolarizing phase of the oscillation was much more pronounced, thus suggesting that the slow rhythm was produced by inhibitory sculpturing of the background firing. The slow oscillation was associated with faster rhythms (4-8 Hz) in the same RE neuron. The slow rhythm of RE neurons was closely related to EEG wave complexes recurring with the same frequency, and its strong dependency upon a synchronized state of cortical EEG was observed during shifts in EEG patterns at different levels of anesthesia. In 44\% of thalamocortical cells the slow rhythm of depolarizing sequences was apparent and it could coexist with delta or spindle oscillations in the same neuron. The occurrence of the slowly recurring depolarizing envelopes was delayed by the hyperpolarizing spindle sequences or by the LTS-AHP sequences of delta oscillation. The hyperpolarization-activated delta potentials that tended to dampen after a few cycles were grouped in sequences recurring with the slow rhythm. We finally propose a unified scenario of the genesis of the three major sleep rhythms: slow, delta, and spindle oscillations.},

  abstract = {Today s problems often arise as unintended consequences of yesterday s solutions. Social systems often suffer from policy resistance, the tendency for well-intentioned interventions to be defeated by the response of the system to the intervention itself. The field of system dynamics, created at MIT in the 1950s by Jay Forrester, is designed to help us learn about the structure and dynamics of the complex systems in which we are embedded, design high-leverage policies for sustained improvement, and catalyze successful implementation and change. Drawing on engineering control theory and the modern theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, system dynamics often involves the development of formal models and management flight simulators to capture complex dynamics, and to create an environment for learning and policy design. Unlike pure engineering problems if any exist human systems present unique challenges, including long time horizons, issues that cross disciplinary boundaries, the need to develop reliable models of human behavior, and the great difficulty of experimental testing. Successful change in social systems also requires the active participation of a wide range of people in the modeling and policy design process, people who often lack technical training. In this paper I discuss requirements for the effective use of system dynamics and illustrate with a successful application to a difficult business issue.},

In general, there is a whole class of DAGs that represents a given set of conditional independence relations. We are interested in properties of this class that can be derived from observations of a subsystem only. To this end, we prove an information-theoretic inequality that allows for the inference of common ancestors of observed parts in any DAG representing some unknown larger system. More explicitly, we show that a large amount of dependence in terms of mutual information among the observations implies the existence of a common ancestor that distributes this information. Within the causal interpretation of DAGs, our result can be seen as a quantitative extension of Reichenbach's principle of common cause to more than two variables. Our conclusions are valid also for non-probabilistic observations, such as binary strings, since we state the proof for an axiomatized notion of ``mutual information'' that includes the stochastic as well as the algorithmic version.},

Normal humans show a diminished vertex-recorded midlatency auditory-evoked potential to the second of paired clicks (0.5 s apart), a phenomenon termed auditory gating. Schizophrenics routinely fail to suppress the response to the second stimulus; thus, they do not gate. Previous animal studies of auditory gating have used psychotomimetic drug administration to induce a schizophrenia-like loss. However, a nonpharmacologic model of deficient gating would be advantageous. Isolation rearing of weanling rats produces impaired prepulse startle inhibition similar to that observed in schizophrenics. The present studied examined the effects of rearing status upon auditory gating. Male Sprague-Dawley rats raised in social isolation (ISO) were compared to socially raised rats (SOC). Across 10 baseline recording sessions, SOC rats showed substantial gating, while ISO rats failed to gate. Abnormal auditory gating is transiently normalized by nicotine, but not haloperidol, in schizophrenics. ISO rats given nicotine bitartrate showed gating in the normal range for 60 min. By contrast, haloperidol failed to normalize gating in ISO rats. Thus, isolation rearing of weanling rats appears to produce a stable schizophrenia-like gating deficiency that shows the same pattern of response to pharmacological interventions.},

  abstract = {Granger causality methods were developed to analyze the flow of information between time series. These methods have become more widely applied in neuroscience. Frequency-domain causality measures, such as those of Geweke, as well as multivariate methods, have particular appeal in neuroscience due to the prevalence of oscillatory phenomena and highly multivariate experimental recordings. Despite its widespread application in many fields, there are ongoing concerns regarding the applicability of Granger causality methods in neuroscience. When are these methods appropriate? How reliably do they recover the system structure underlying the observed data? What do frequency-domain causality measures tell us about the functional properties of oscillatory neural systems? In this paper, we analyze fundamental properties of Granger\textendash Geweke (GG) causality, both computational and conceptual. Specifically, we show that (               i               ) GG causality estimates can be either severely biased or of high variance, both leading to spurious results; (               ii               ) even if estimated correctly, GG causality estimates alone are not interpretable without examining the component behaviors of the system model; and (               iii               ) GG causality ignores critical components of a system's dynamics. Based on this analysis, we find that the notion of causality quantified is incompatible with the objectives of many neuroscience investigations, leading to highly counterintuitive and potentially misleading results. Through the analysis of these problems, we provide important conceptual clarification of GG causality, with implications for other related causality approaches and for the role of causality analyses in neuroscience as a whole.},

Increased odor concentration led to changes in the firing patterns of individual antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs), similar to those caused by changes in odor identity, thus potentially confounding representations for identity and concentration. However, when these time-varying responses were examined across many PNs, concentration-specific patterns clustered by identity, resolving the apparent confound. This is because PN ensemble representations changed relatively continuously over a range of concentrations of each odorant. The PNs' targets in the mushroom body-Kenyon cells (KCs)-had sparse identity-specific responses with diverse degrees of concentration invariance. The tuning of KCs to identity and concentration and the patterning of their responses are consistent with piecewise decoding of their PN inputs over oscillation-cycle length epochs.},

Participants included outpatients with schizophrenia (SZ; n = 201), a bipolar disorder (BD; n = 46) clinical comparison group, and healthy controls (CN; n = 27) who were rated on the Brief Negative Symptom Scale. The mutual information measure was used to construct negative symptom networks. Groups were compared on macroscopic network properties to evaluate overall network connectedness, and microscopic properties to determine which domains were most central. Macroscopic analyses indicated that patients with SZ had a less densely connected negative symptom network than BD or CN groups, and that males with SZ had less densely connected networks than females. Microscopic analyses indicated that alogia and avolition were most central in the SZ group, whereas anhedonia was most central in BD and CN groups. In addition, blunted affect, alogia, and asociality were most central in females with SZ, and alogia and avolition were most central in males with SZ. These findings suggest that negative symptoms may be highly treatment resistant in SZ because they are not very densely connected. Less densely connected networks may make treatments less likely to achieve global reductions in negative symptoms because individual domains function in isolation with little interaction. Sex differences in centralities suggest that the search for pathophysiological mechanisms and targeted treatment development should be focused on different sets of symptoms in males and females.},

The standard approach to this problem is to use Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that are based on the classic work of Metropolis et al. (1953). Although great improvements to these original ideas have been made, there remains scope for improvement. The first polynomial time algorithm for the estimation of the partition function was developed by Jerrum and Sinclair (1993), who reduced the problem to counting subgraphs via the high-temperature expansion. However, the polynomial bound achieved has large degree and so yields an algorithm that is too slow for practical use. Our approach, which also uses the high-temperature expansion, yields a broad class of Monte Carlo algorithms that are not based on the work of Metropolis et al., but instead use heuristic sampling techniques. In particular, we estimate coefficients of a polynomial that, once obtained, can be used to determine the quantities of interest at all temperatures simultaneously. This class of algorithms can be applied to any underlying graph, with or without an external field. These algorithms are also highly parallelizable, which, among other features, makes their implementation possible in practice.},

  abstract = {Background: Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories. Results: Simulation studies are presented illustrating that, when random forest variable importance measures are used with data of varying types, the results are misleading because suboptimal predictor variables may be artificially preferred in variable selection. The two mechanisms underlying this deficiency are biased variable selection in the individual classification trees used to build the random forest on one hand, and effects induced by bootstrap sampling with replacement on the other hand. Conclusion: We propose to employ an alternative implementation of random forests, that provides unbiased variable selection in the individual classification trees. When this method is applied using subsampling without replacement, the resulting variable importance measures can be used reliably for variable selection even in situations where the potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. The usage of both random forest algorithms and their variable importance measures in the R system for statistical computing is illustrated and documented thoroughly in an application re-analyzing data from a study on RNA editing. Therefore the suggested method can be applied straightforwardly by scientists in bioinformatics research.},

Predicting the severity and spatial extent of any temperature increase during optogenetic stimulation is therefore of considerable importance. Here, we describe a realistic model that simulates light and heat propagation during optogenetic experiments. We validated the model by comparing predicted and measured temperature changes in vivo. We further demonstrate the utility of this model by comparing predictions for various wavelengths of light and fiber sizes, as well as testing methods for reducing heat effects on neural targets in vivo.},

  abstract = {Inference of causality is central in nonlinear time series analysis and science in general. A popular approach to infer causality between two processes is to measure the information flow between them in terms of transfer entropy. Using dynamics of coupled oscillator networks, we show that although transfer entropy can successfully detect information flow in two processes, it often results in erroneous identification of network connections under the presence of indirect interactions, dominance of neighbors, or anticipatory couplings. Such effects are found to be profound for time-dependent networks. To overcome these limitations, we develop a measure called causation entropy, and show that its application can lead to reliable identification of true couplings.},

  abstract = {Two primary properties of complex networks, controllability and modularity not only are closely related to each other, but also play an important role in understanding the networks' characteristics. In this paper, we discuss an elastic model to enhance the control of undirected networks and study the controllability of random networks with built-in gradually varied modularity as well as real-world networks to elaborate the correlation between the networks' controllability and modularity. The results show that it is easier to control the networks with stronger modularity than that of weaker modularity, and the networks with larger size communities probably need more driver nodes to control than that of smaller size communities when we fix both the number of nodes and the number of links of the networks. In addition, the robustness analysis indicates that the model enhances the resistance of networks against link failure. This work shows that the controllability of complex networks is highly associated with the networks' degree distribution as well as the networks' modularity, which gives a new insight into the understanding of controllability and modularity of complex networks.},

They evaluate the effect of bilateral damage to the hippocampus on performance by human participants in a virtual 8-arm radial maze. The hippocampal damage appears to be highly selective and nearly complete. Exactly as with selective hippocampal damage in rats, the human participants showed a deficit in accurately choosing rewarded versus never-rewarded arms and a deficit in avoiding reentering recently visited arms. The results are triply significant: (1) They provide good support for the idea that the wealth of neurobiological information, from network to synapse to gene, on spatial memory in the rat may apply as a whole to the human hippocampal memory system; (2) They affirm the utility of human virtual task models of rat spatial memory tasks; (3) They support one interpretation of the dampening of the hippocampal functional MRI (fMRI) blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal during performance of the virtual radial arm maze observed by Astur et al. (2005).},

In this letter, we employ a squared-loss variant of mutual information as an independence measure and give its estimation method. Our basic idea is to estimate the ratio of probability densities directly without going through density estimation, thereby avoiding the difficult task of density estimation. In this density ratio approach, a natural cross-validation procedure is available for hyperparameter selection. Thus, all tuning parameters such as the kernel width or the regularization parameter can be objectively optimized. This is an advantage over recently developed kernel-based independence measures and is a highly useful property in unsupervised learning problems such as ICA. Based on this novel independence measure, we develop an ICA algorithm, named least-squares independent component analysis. \textcopyright{} 2010 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

We explore the features of EMD, including making a quantitative assessment of its ability to preserve phase content of signals, and proceed to develop a statistical framework with which to assess synchrony episodes. Furthermore, we propose a new approach to ensure signal decomposition using EMD. We adapt the Hilbert spectrum to a time-frequency representation of phase locking and are able to locate synchrony successfully in time and frequency between synthetic signals reminiscent of EEG. We compare our approach, which we call EMD phase locking analysis (EMDPL) with existing methods and show it to offer improved time-frequency localisation of synchrony.},

But crippling the work of criminal organizations is not possible unless investigators can identify the most influential, high-level members and monitor their communication channels. Investigators often approach this task by requesting the mobile phone service records of the arrested low-level criminals to identify contacts, and then they build a network model of the organization, where each node denotes a criminal and the edges represent communications. Network analysis can be used to infer the most influential criminals and most important communication channels within the network, but screening all the nodes and links in a network is laborious and time consuming. Here, we propose a new forensic analysis system called identifying influential criminals and their communication channels (IICCC) that can effectively and efficiently infer the high-level criminals and short-list the important communication channels in a criminal organization, based on the mobile phone communications of its members. IICCC can also be used to build a network from crime incident reports. We evaluated IICCC experimentally and compared it with five other systems, confirming its superior prediction performance.},

  abstract = {The optogenetic approach to primate brain circuitry has unparalleled potential for uncovering genetically and temporally resolved neuronal mechanisms of higher brain functions. In order to optogenetically investigate the large and complex primate brain, an optical-/electrical probe, or "optrode", must be inserted deeply, which requires the optrode to be not only long and stiff, but also sharp and smooth to reduce possible tissue damage. This study presents a tungsten microelectrode-based optrode that encloses optical fibers within its insulation glass. Optical fibers and a tungsten wire were tightly bound to each other and integrally coated with a smooth, thin layer of glass. This design satisfied the structural requirements for use in deep brain structures. The performance of the optrode was then examined in the thalamus of the rat and macaque monkeys which were injected with lentiviral vectors carrying the channelrhodopsin-2-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (ChR2-EYFP) transgene. With fluorescence measurements via the optical fiber, ChR2-EYFP expression was detected clearly in vivo, which was confirmed by histological analysis in the rat. With photostimulation and extracellular recording, photo-responsive single-unit activities were isolated in the monkeys. The depth distribution of these units and the peak of the EYFP fluorescence profile overlapped consistently with each other. Thus, by developing a new probe, optogenetic methodology was successfully applied to a primate subcortical structure. This smooth glass-coated optrode is a promising tool for chronic in vivo experiments with various research targets including deep brain structures in behaving monkeys. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Several such strategies exist, but there has been no direct demonstration of reversible inactivation of mammalian neurons in vivo. We previously reported quickly reversible inactivation of neurons in vitro using expression of the Drosophila allatostatin receptor (AlstR). Here, adeno-associated viral vectors are used to express AlstR in vivo in cortical and thalamic neurons of rats, ferrets, and monkeys. Application of the receptor's ligand, allatostatin (AL), leads to a dramatic reduction in neural activity, including responses of visual neurons to optimized visual stimuli. Additionally, AL eliminates activity in spinal cords of transgenic mice conditionally expressing AlstR. This reduction occurs selectively in AlstR-expressing neurons. Inactivation can be reversed within minutes upon washout of the ligand and is repeatable, demonstrating that the AlstR/AL system is effective for selective, quick, and reversible silencing of mammalian neurons in vivo. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Many social, biological, and technological networks consist of a small number of highly connected components (hubs) and a very large number of loosely connected components (low-degree nodes). It has been commonly recognized that such heterogeneously connected networks are extremely vulnerable to the failure of hubs in terms of structural robustness of complex networks. However, little is known about dynamical robustness, which refers to the ability of a network to maintain its dynamical activity against local perturbations. Here we demonstrate that, in contrast to the structural fragility, the nonlinear dynamics of heterogeneously connected networks can be highly vulnerable to the failure of low-degree nodes. The crucial role of low-degree nodes results from dynamical processes where normal (active) units compensate for the failure of neighboring (inactive) units at the expense of a reduction in their own activity. Our finding highlights the significant difference between structural and dynamical robustness in complex networks.},

  abstract = {The ability to effectively control brain dynamics holds great promise for the enhancement of cognitive function in humans, and the betterment of their quality of life. Yet, successfully controlling dynamics in neural systems is challenging, in part due to the immense complexity of the brain and the large set of interactions that can drive any single change. While we have gained some understanding of the control of single neurons, the control of large-scale neural systems -- networks of multiply interacting components -- remains poorly understood. Efforts to address this gap include the construction of tools for the control of brain networks, mostly adapted from control and dynamical systems theory. Informed by current opportunities for practical intervention, these theoretical contributions provide models that draw from a wide array of mathematical approaches. We present intriguing recent developments for effective strategies of control in dynamic brain networks, and we also describe potential mechanisms that underlie such processes. We review efforts in the control of general neurophysiological processes with implications for brain development and cognitive function, as well as the control of altered neurophysiological processes in medical contexts such as anesthesia administration, seizure suppression, and deep-brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. We conclude with a forward-looking discussion regarding how emerging results from network control -- especially approaches that deal with nonlinear dynamics or more realistic trajectories for control transitions -- could be used to directly address pressing questions in neuroscience.},

  abstract = {Interactions are ubiquitous and have been extensively studied in many ecological, evolutionary, and physiological systems. A variety of measures\textemdash ANOVA, covariance, epistatic additivity, mutual information, joint cumulants, Bliss independence\textemdash exist that compute interactions across fields. However, these are not discussed and derived within a single, general framework. This missing framework likely contributes to the confusion about proper formulations and interpretations of higher-order interactions. Intriguingly, despite higher-order interactions having received little attention, they have been recently discovered to be highly prevalent and to likely impact the dynamics of complex biological systems. Here, we introduce a single, explicit mathematical framework that simultaneously encompasses all of these measures of pairwise interactions. The generality and simplicity of this framework allows us to establish a rigorous method for deriving higher-order interaction measures based on any of the pairwise interactions listed above. These generalized higher-order interaction measures enable the exploration of emergent phenomena across systems such as multiple predator effects, gene epistasis, and environmental stressors. These results provide a mechanistic basis to better account for how interactions affect biological systems. Our theoretical advance provides a foundation for understanding multi-component interactions in complex systems such as evolving populations within ecosystems or communities.},

  abstract = {The notion of entropy is ubiquitous both in natural and social sciences. In the last two decades, a considerable effort has been devoted to the study of new entropic forms, which generalize the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropy and could be applicable in thermodynamics, quantum mechanics and information theory. In Khinchin (1957), by extending previous ideas of Shannon (1948) and Shannon and Weaver (1949), Khinchin proposed a characterization of the BG entropy, based on four requirements, nowadays known as the Shannon-Khinchin (SK) axioms.The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we show that there exists an intrinsic group-theoretical structure behind the notion of entropy. It comes from the requirement of composability of an entropy with respect to the union of two statistically independent systems, that we propose in an axiomatic formulation. Second, we show that there exists a simple universal family of trace-form entropies. This class contains many well known examples of entropies and infinitely many new ones, a priori multi-parametric. Due to its specific relation with Lazard's universal formal group of algebraic topology, the new general entropy introduced in this work will be called the universal-group entropy. A new example of multi-parametric entropy is explicitly constructed.},

  abstract = {Synesthesia is an unusual condition characterized by the over-binding of two or more features and the concomitant automatic and conscious experience of atypical, ancillary images or perceptions [1-3]. Previous research suggests that synesthetes display enhanced modality-specific perceptual processing [4-7], but it remains unclear whether enhanced processing contributes to conscious awareness of color photisms. In three experiments, we investigated whether grapheme-color synesthesia is characterized by enhanced cortical excitability in primary visual cortex and the role played by this hyperexcitability in the expression of synesthesia. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we show that synesthetes display 3-fold lower phosphene thresholds than controls during stimulation of the primary visual cortex. We next used transcranial direct current stimulation to discriminate between two competing hypotheses of the role of hyperexcitability in the expression of synesthesia. We demonstrate that synesthesia can be selectively augmented with cathodal stimulation and attenuated with anodal stimulation of primary visual cortex. A control task revealed that the effect of the brain stimulation was specific to the experience of synesthesia. These results indicate that hyperexcitability acts as a source of noise in visual cortex that influences the availability of the neuronal signals underlying conscious awareness of synesthetic photisms. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {We employ viral vectors to address questions related to the function of specific types of neurones in the central control of blood pressure. Adenoviral vectors (AVVs) or lentiviral vectors (LVVs) can be used to visualize specifically living GABAergic or noradrenergic (NAergic) neurones or to interfere with intracellular signalling within these cell types. Here, we review recent in vitro, in situ and in vivo applications of these vectors in the rat brainstem as performed in our laboratories. In organotypic slice cultures prepared from defined cardiovascular brainstem areas, viral vectors were used to study the electrophysiological properties, intracellular signalling and gene expression in selected neuronal phenotypes. In vivo, vectors were microinjected into brainstem nuclei to inhibit specific aspects of cell signalling by expression of dominant negative proteins, for example. Outcomes for cardiovascular control were measured either acutely in situ or chronically in vivo with radio telemetry in freely moving rats. We showed that AVVs and LVVs have distinct properties that need to be considered prior to their application. For example, LVVs can be manufactured very quickly, have no immunogenicity and can be pseudotyped to display higher tropism for neurones than glia. However, comparatively lower production yields of LVVs may limit their use for some types of applications. In contrast, AVVs require a lengthy construction period, are easy to amplify to high yields at moderate cost but may trigger an immune response when used at high titres in vivo. These features make AVVs particularly suitable for in vitro applications. As the two vector types complement each other in several ways we generated a shuttle system that simplifies transfer of transgene cassettes between the backbones of AVVs and LVVs. Thus, AVVs and LVVs are powerful experimental tools that can be used in a variety of experimental designs in vivo, in situ and in vitro.},

The model allows interesting comparisons among the different economies related to the compositions of the national baskets. Synthetic solutions can also be used to estimate hidden and unexploited growth potentials. These prerogatives are strictly connected with the fact that a network structure is at the basis of the model. Such a network expresses the mutual influences of different products through resource transfers, and is a key ingredient producing cooperative growth effects which can be quantified and distinguished from those generated by deterministic drifts and representing direct resource inputs. An analysis of this network, which differs substantially from those previously considered within the economic complexity approach, allows to estimate the centrality of different products in each national basket, highlighting the most essential commodities for each economy. Solutions of the model give the possibility of performing counterfactual analyses aimed at estimating how much the growth of each country could have profited from a general strengthening, or weakening, of the links in the same products network.},

The supply chain can be a key consideration in product design, with its design and operations influenced by concerns about uncertain energy costs, sustainability, economic security, and other complex issues. Because of these and other considerations, the contemporary practice in which an analysis model is the first "formal" model of the logistics system is no longer feasible. Rather, what is required for a sustainable practice of simulation in logistics is a model-based approach which begins with a formal language for capturing a defining description of the logistics system itself. This formal language must be sufficiently accessible to the logistics systems stakeholders so that they can validate the resulting system description. The resulting descriptive model will be the basis for subsequent analyses, including simulation. In this context, we address the requirements for such a formal language, describe our initial progress in developing such a language for logistics systems, and place it in the context of prior work on "reference models". \textcopyright{} 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a basic revision of the understanding of teleology in biological sciences. Since Kant, it has become customary to view purposiveness in organisms as a bias added by the observer; the recent notion of teleonomy expresses well this as-if character of natural purposes. In recent developments in science, however, notions such as self-organization (or complex systems) and the autopoiesis viewpoint, have displaced emergence and circular self-production as central features of life. Contrary to an often superficial reading, Kant gives a multi-faceted account of the living, and anticipates this modern reading of the organism, even introducing the term self-organization for the first time. Our re-reading of Kant in this light is strengthened by a group of philosophers of biology, with Hans Jonas as the central figure, who put back on center stage an organism-centered view of the living, an autonomous center of concern capable of providing an interior perspective. Thus, what is present in nuce in Kant, finds a convergent development from this current of philosophy of biology and the scientific ideas around autopoeisis, two independent but parallel developments culminating in the 1970s. Instead of viewing meaning or value as artifacts or illusions, both agree on a new understanding of a form of immanent teleology as truly biological features, inevitably intertwined with the self-establishment of an identity which is the living process.},

  abstract = {This book is a comprehensive introduction to quantitative approaches to complex adaptive systems. Practically all areas of life on this planet are constantly confronted with complex systems, be it ecosystems, societies, traffic, financial markets, opinion formation, epidemic spreading, or the internet and social media. Complex systems are systems composed of many elements that interact with each other, which makes them extremely rich dynamical systems showing a huge range of phenomena. Properties of complex systems that are of particular importance are their efficiency, robustness, resilience, and proneness to collapse. The quantitative tools and concepts needed to understand the co-evolutionary nature of networked systems and their properties are challenging. The intention of the book is to give a self-contained introduction to these concepts so that the reader will be equipped with a conceptual and mathematical toolset that allows her to engage in the science of complex systems. Topics covered include random processes of path-dependent processes, co-evolutionary dynamics, the statistics of driven nonequilibrium systems, dynamics of networks, the theory of scaling, and approaches from statistical mechanics and information theory. The book extends well beyond the early classical literature in the field of complex systems and summarizes the methodological progress over the past twenty years in a clear, structured, and comprehensive way. The book is intended for natural scientists and graduate students.},

  abstract = {Covertly directing visual attention toward a spatial location in the absence of visual stimulation enhances future visual processing at the attended position. The neuronal correlates of these attention shifts involve modulation of neuronal "baseline" activity in early visual areas, presumably through top-down control from higher-order attentional systems. We used electroencephalography to study the largely unknown relationship between these neuronal modulations and behavioral outcome in an attention orienting paradigm. Covert visuospatial attention shifts to either a left or right peripheral position in the absence of visual stimulation resulted in differential modulations of oscillatory alpha-band (8-14 Hz) activity over left versus right posterior sites. These changes were driven by varying degrees of alpha-decreases being maximal contralateral to the attended position. When expressed as a lateralization index, these alpha-changes differed significantly between attention conditions, with negative values (alpha\_right {$<$} alpha\_left) indexing leftward and more positive values (alpha\_left {$<$} or = alpha\_right) indexing rightward attention. Moreover, this index appeared deterministic for processing of forthcoming visual targets. Collapsed over trials, there was an advantage for left target processing in accordance with an overall negative bias in alpha-index values. Across trials, left targets were detected most rapidly when preceded by negative index values. Detection of right targets was fastest in trials with most positive values. Our data indicate that collateral modulations of posterior alpha-activity, the momentary bias of visuospatial attention, and imminent visual processing are linked. They suggest that the momentary direction of attention, predicting spatial biases in imminent visual processing, can be estimated from a lateralization index of posterior alpha-activity.},

Examples include the information that face images provide about the names of the people portrayed, or the information that speech sounds provide about the words spoken. Understanding the signal \$x\$ requires more than just predicting \$y\$, it also requires specifying which features of \$\textbackslash X\$ play a role in the prediction. We formalize this problem as that of finding a short code for \$\textbackslash X\$ that preserves the maximum information about \$\textbackslash Y\$. That is, we squeeze the information that \$\textbackslash X\$ provides about \$\textbackslash Y\$ through a `bottleneck' formed by a limited set of codewords \$\textbackslash tX\$. This constrained optimization problem can be seen as a generalization of rate distortion theory in which the distortion measure \$d(x,\textbackslash x)\$ emerges from the joint statistics of \$\textbackslash X\$ and \$\textbackslash Y\$. This approach yields an exact set of self consistent equations for the coding rules \$X \textbackslash to \textbackslash tX\$ and \$\textbackslash tX \textbackslash to \textbackslash Y\$. Solutions to these equations can be found by a convergent re-estimation method that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. Our variational principle provides a surprisingly rich framework for discussing a variety of problems in signal processing and learning, as will be described in detail elsewhere.},

Most of this work has focused on capturing the measured correlations among pairs of neurons. Here we suggest an alternative, constructing models that are consistent with the distribution of global network activity, i.e. the probability that K out of N cells in the network generate action potentials in the same small time bin. The inverse problem that we need to solve in constructing the model is analytically tractable, and provides a natural "thermodynamics" for the network in the limit of large N. We analyze the responses of neurons in a small patch of the retina to naturalistic stimuli, and find that the implied thermodynamics is very close to an unusual critical point, in which the entropy (in proper units) is exactly equal to the energy.},

Two separate but mutually interacting sub-systems are investigated: a starving environment and the network. We assume that the slow modes of the environment growth can be modeled with classical cellular automata (CA) approach. The fast modes representing the transportation network, we approximate by the graph of cellular automata (GCA). This allows the simulation of transportation systems over larger spatio-temporal scales and scrutinizing global interactions between the network and the environment. We show that the model can mimic the realistic evolution of complex river systems. We also demonstrate how the model can simulate a reverse situation. We conclude that the paradigm of this model can be extended further to a general framework, approximating many realistic multiscale transportation systems in diverse fields such as geology, biology and medicine. \textcopyright{} World Scientific Publishing Company.},

This search outputs the occurrence count (support) of individual patterns that are not trivially explained by the counts of any superset (closed frequent item sets). The number of patterns found by FIM makes direct statistical tests infeasible due to severe multiple testing. To overcome this issue, we proposed to test the significance not of individual patterns, but instead of their signatures, defined as the pairs of pattern size z and support c. Here, we derive in detail a statistical test for the significance of the signatures under the null hypothesis of full independence (pattern spectrum filtering, PSF) by means of surrogate data. As a result, injected spike patterns that mimic assembly activity are well detected, yielding a low false negative rate. However, this approach is prone to additionally classify patterns resulting from chance overlap of real assembly activity and background spiking as significant. These patterns represent false positives with respect to the null hypothesis of having one assembly of given signature embedded in otherwise independent spiking activity. We propose the additional method of pattern set reduction (PSR) to remove these false positives by conditional filtering. By employing stochastic simulations of parallel spike trains with correlated activity in form of injected spike synchrony in subsets of the neurons, we demonstrate for a range of parameter settings that the analysis scheme composed of FIM, PSF and PSR allows to reliably detect active assemblies in massively parallel spike trains.},

  abstract = {With the ability to observe the activity from large numbers of neurons simultaneously using modern recording technologies, the chance to identify sub-networks involved in coordinated processing increases. Sequences of synchronous spike events (SSEs) constitute one type of such coordinated spiking that propagates activity in a temporally precise manner. The synfire chain was proposed as one potential model for such network processing. Previous work introduced a method for visualization of SSEs in massively parallel spike trains, based on an intersection matrix that contains in each entry the degree of overlap of active neurons in two corresponding time bins. Repeated SSEs are reflected in thematrix as diagonal structures of high overlap values. The method as such, however, leaves the task of identify- ing these diagonal structures to visual inspection rather than to a quantitative analysis. Here we present ASSET (Analysis of Sequences of Synchronous EvenTs), an improved, fully automated method which determines diagonal structures in the intersection matrix by a robust mathematical procedure. The method consists of a sequence of steps that i) assess which entries in the matrix potentially belong to a diagonal structure, ii) cluster these entries into individual diagonal structures and iii) determine the neurons composing the associated SSEs. We employ parallel point processes generated by stochastic simulations as test data to demonstrate the performance of the method under a wide range of realistic scenarios, including different types of non-stationarity of the spiking activity and different correlation structures. Finally, the ability of the method to discover SSEs is demonstrated on complex data from large network simulations with embedded synfire chains. Thus, ASSET repre- sents an effective and efficient tool to analyze massively parallel spike data for temporal sequences of synchronous activity.},

The wide variety of implementations has resulted in two key challenges: the progenation of many domain-specific strategies that are seldom revisited or questioned, and the siloing of ideas within a domain due to inconsistency of complex systems language. In this work we offer basic, domain-agnostic language in order to advance towards a more cohesive vocabulary. We use this language to evaluate each step of the complex systems analysis pipeline, beginning with the system and data collected, then moving through different mathematical formalisms for encoding the observed data (i.e. graphs, simplicial complexes, and hypergraphs), and relevant computational methods for each formalism. At each step we consider different types of \textbackslash emph\{dependencies\}; these are properties of the system that describe how the existence of one relation among the parts of a system may influence the existence of another relation. We discuss how dependencies may arise and how they may alter interpretation of results or the entirety of the analysis pipeline. We close with two real-world examples using coauthorship data and email communications data that illustrate how the system under study, the dependencies therein, the research question, and choice of mathematical representation influence the results. We hope this work can serve as an opportunity of reflection for experienced complexity scientists, as well as an introductory resource for new researchers.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces three novel centrality measures based on the nodes' role in the operation of a joint task, i.e., their position in a criminal network value chain. For this, we consider networks where nodes have attributes describing their ``capabilities'' or ``colors'', i.e., the possible roles they may play in a value chain. A value chain here is understood as a series of tasks to be performed in a specific order, each requiring a specific capability. The first centrality notion measures how many value chain instances a given node participates in. The other two assess the costs of replacing a node in the value chain in case the given node is no longer available to perform the task. The first of them considers the direct distance (shortest path length) between the node in question and its nearest replacement, while the second evaluates the actual replacement process, assuming that preceding and following nodes in the network should each be able to find and contact the replacement. In this report, we demonstrate the properties of the new centrality measures using a few toy examples and compare them to classic centralities, such as betweenness, closeness and degree centrality. We also apply the new measures to randomly colored empirical networks. We find that the newly introduced centralities differ sufficiently from the classic measures, pointing towards different aspects of the network. Our results also pinpoint the difference between having a replacement node in the network and being able to find one. This is the reason why ``introduction distance'' often has a noticeable correlation with betweenness. Our studies show that projecting value chains over networks may significantly alter the nodes' perceived importance. These insights might have important implications for the way law enforcement or intelligence agencies look at the effectiveness of dark network disruption strategies over time.},

  abstract = {We propose an information-theoretic framework for analyzing control systems based on the close relationship of controllers to communication channels. A communication channel takes an input state and transforms it into an output state. A controller, similarly, takes the initial state of a system to be controlled and transforms it into a target state. In this sense, a controller can be thought of as an actuation channel that acts on inputs to produce desired outputs. In this transformation process, two different control strategies can be adopted: (i) the controller applies an actuation dynamics that is independent of the state of the system to be controlled (open-loop control); or (ii) the controller enacts an actuation dynamics that is based on some information about the state of the controlled system (closed-loop control). Using this communication channel model of control, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a system to be perfectly controllable and perfectly observable in terms of information and entropy. In addition, we derive a quantitative trade-off between the amount of information gathered by a closed-loop controller and its relative performance advantage over an open-loop controller in stabilizing a system. This work supplements earlier results (Phys. Rev. Lett. 84 (2000) 1156) by providing new derivations of the advantage afforded by closed-loop control and by proposing an information-based optimality criterion for control systems. New applications of this approach pertaining to proportional controllers, and the control of chaotic maps are also presented. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The statistical estimation and tests of hypotheses are based on the likelihood principle derived from stationary point processes and time series. Algorithms and software development are given in each chapter to reproduce the computer simulated results described therein. The book examines current statistical methods for solving emerging problems in neuroscience. These methods have been applied to data involving multichannel neural spike train, spike sorting, blind source separation, functional and effective neural connectivity, spatiotemporal modeling, and multimodal neuroimaging techniques. The author provides an overview of various methods being applied to specific research areas of neuroscience, emphasizing statistical principles and their software. The book includes examples and experimental data so that readers can understand the principles and master the methods. The first part of the book deals with the traditional multivariate time series analysis applied to the context of multichannel spike trains and fMRI using respectively the probability structures or likelihood associated with time-to-fire and discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) of point processes. The second part introduces a relatively new form of statistical spatiotemporal modeling for fMRI and EEG data analysis. In addition to neural scientists and statisticians, anyone wishing to employ intense computing methods to extract important features and information directly from data rather than relying heavily on models built on leading cases such as linear regression or Gaussian processes will find this book extremely helpful.},

The discovery of chaotic itinerancy in high-dimensional dynamical systems with and without a noise term has motivated a new interpretation of this dynamic neural activity, cast in terms of the high-dimensional transitory dynamics among "exotic" attractors. This interpretation is quite different from the conventional one, cast in terms of simple behavior on low-dimensional attractors. Skarda and Freeman (1987) presented evidence in support of the conclusion that animals cannot memorize odor without chaotic activity of neuron populations. Following their work, we study the role of chaotic dynamics in biological information processing, perception, and memory. We propose a new coding scheme of information in chaos-driven contracting systems we refer to as Cantor coding. Since these systems are found in the hippocampal formation and also in the olfactory system, the proposed coding scheme should be of biological significance. Based on these intensive studies, a hypothesis regarding the formation of episodic memory is given.},

Conceptualisations and operationalisations of connectivity have evolved largely within their disciplinary boundaries, yet similarities in this concept and its application among disciplines are evident. However, any implementation of the concept of connectivity carries with it both ontological and epistemological constraints, which leads us to ask if there is one type or set of approach(es) to connectivity that might be applied to all disciplines. In this review we explore four ontological and epistemological challenges in using connectivity to understand complex systems from the standpoint of widely different disciplines. These are: (i) defining the fundamental unit for the study of connectivity; (ii) separating structural connectivity from functional connectivity; (iii) understanding emergent behaviour; and (iv) measuring connectivity. We draw upon discipline-specific insights from Computational Neuroscience, Ecology, Geomorphology, Neuroscience, Social Network Science and Systems Biology to explore the use of connectivity among these disciplines. We evaluate how a connectivity-based approach has generated new understanding of structural-functional relationships that characterise complex systems and propose a `common toolbox' underpinned by network-based approaches that can advance connectivity studies by overcoming existing constraints.},

Anxiety disorders represent the most common of psychiatric diseases (28\% lifetime prevalence) and contribute to the aetiology of major depression and substance abuse. Although it has been proposed that the amygdala, a brain region important for emotional processing, has a role in anxiety, the neural mechanisms that control anxiety remain unclear. Here we explore the neural circuits underlying anxiety-related behaviours by using optogenetics with two-photon microscopy, anxiety assays in freely moving mice, and electrophysiology. With the capability of optogenetics to control not only cell types but also specific connections between cells, we observed that temporally precise optogenetic stimulation of basolateral amygdala (BLA) terminals in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA)\textemdash achieved by viral transduction of the BLA with a codon-optimized channelrhodopsin followed by restricted illumination in the downstream CeA\textemdash exerted an acute, reversible anxiolytic effect. Conversely, selective optogenetic inhibition of the same projection with a third-generation halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) increased anxiety-related behaviours. Importantly, these effects were not observed with direct optogenetic control of BLA somata, possibly owing to recruitment of antagonistic downstream structures. Together, these results implicate specific BLA\textendash CeA projections as critical circuit elements for acute anxiety control in the mammalian brain, and demonstrate the importance of optogenetically targeting defined projections, beyond simply targeting cell types, in the study of circuit function relevant to neuropsychiatric disease.},

In patients with schizophrenia, the synchronization of beta- and gamma-band activity is abnormal, suggesting a crucial role for dysfunctional oscillations in the generation of the cognitive deficits and other symptoms of the disorder.

First, we discuss what criterion is adopted for trajectory determination. Several resear- chers measured the hand trajectories of skilled move- ments and found common invariant features. For example, when moving the hand between a pair of targets, subjects tended to generate roughly straight hand paths with bell-shaped speed profiles. On the basis of these observations and dynamic optimization theory, we propose a mathematical model which accounts for formation of hand trajectories. This model is formulated by defining an objective function, a measure of performance for any possible movement: square of the rate of change of torque integrated over the entire movement.},

In the present paper, we present a method for assessing network structures from binary data. Although models for binary data are infamous for their computational intractability, we present a computationally efficient model for estimating network structures. The approach, which is based on Ising models as used in physics, combines logistic regression with model selection based on a Goodness-of-Fit measure to identify relevant relationships between variables that define connections in a network. A validation study shows that this method succeeds in revealing the most relevant features of a network for realistic sample sizes. We apply our proposed method to estimate the network of depression and anxiety symptoms from symptom scores of 1108 subjects. Possible extensions of the model are discussed.},

  abstract = {The human brain is a complex network of interlinked regions. Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a number of highly connected and highly central neocortical hub regions, regions that play a key role in global information integration between different parts of the network. The potential functional importance of these "brain hubs" is underscored by recent studies showing that disturbances of their structural and functional connectivity profile are linked to neuropathology. This study aims to map out both the subcortical and neocortical hubs of the brain and examine their mutual relationship, particularly their structural linkages. Here, we demonstrate that brain hubs form a so-called "rich club," characterized by a tendency for high-degree nodes to be more densely connected among themselves than nodes of a lower degree, providing important information on the higher-level topology of the brain network. Whole-brain structural networks of 21 subjects were reconstructed using diffusion tensor imaging data. Examining the connectivity profile of these networks revealed a group of 12 strongly interconnected bihemispheric hub regions, comprising the precuneus, superior frontal and superior parietal cortex, as well as the subcortical hippocampus, putamen, and thalamus. Importantly, these hub regions were found to be more densely interconnected than would be expected based solely on their degree, together forming a rich club. We discuss the potential functional implications of the rich-club organization of the human connectome, particularly in light of its role in information integration and in conferring robustness to its structural core.},

  abstract = {Virtually all domains of cognitive function require the integration of distributed neural activity. Network analysis of human brain connectivity has consistently identified sets of regions that are critically important for enabling efficient neuronal signaling and communication. The central embedding of these candidate 'brain hubs' in anatomical networks supports their diverse functional roles across a broad range of cognitive tasks and widespread dynamic coupling within and across functional networks. The high level of centrality of brain hubs also renders them points of vulnerability that are susceptible to disconnection and dysfunction in brain disorders. Combining data from numerous empirical and computational studies, network approaches strongly suggest that brain hubs play important roles in information integration underpinning numerous aspects of complex cognitive function. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The enduring nature of relapse suggests that it is maintained by long-lasting molecular and cellular adaptations in the neuronal circuitry that mediates learning and processing of motivationally relevant stimuli. Studies employing the reinstatement model of drug relapse in rodents point to an important role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), with distinct contributions of the dorsal and ventral regions of the mPFC to drug-, stress- and cue-induced drug seeking. Whereas drug-induced neuroadaptations in the dorsal mPFC function to enhance excitatory output and drive expression of drug seeking, recent evidence suggests that plasticity in the ventral mPFC leads to reduced glutamatergic transmission in this region, thereby impairing response inhibition upon exposure to drug-conditioned stimuli. Treatments aimed at restoring drug-induced neuroadaptations in the mPFC may help to reduce cue-reactivity and relapse susceptibility.},

These communities may have any shape, as long as they are connected. For these hierarchical graphs, we find the size of the largest component, the degree distribution and the clustering coefficient. Furthermore, we determine the conditions under which a giant percolation cluster exists, and find its size.},

The positive manifold is often explained by positing a dominant latent variable, the g factor, associated with a single quantitative cognitive or biological process or capacity. In this article, a new explanation of the positive manifold based on a dynamical model is proposed, in which reciprocal causation or mutualism plays a central role. It is shown that the positive manifold emerges purely by positive beneficial interactions between cognitive processes during development. A single underlying g factor plays no role in the model. The model offers explanations of important findings in intelligence research, such as the hierarchical factor structure of intelligence, the low predictability of intelligence from early childhood performance, the integration/differentiation effect, the increase in heritability of g, and the Jensen effect, and is consistent with current explanations of the Flynn effect.},

This highlights the urgency to better understand the complex dynamics of these individuals and organizations in order to timely detect critical social phase transitions that form a risk for society. In this paper we introduce a new multi-level modelling approach that integrates insights from complex systems, criminology, psychology, and organizational studies with agent-based modelling. We use a bottom-up approach to model the active and adaptive reactions by individuals to the society, the economic situation and law enforcement activity. This approach enables analyzing the behavioral transitions of individuals and associated micro processes, and the emergent networks and organizations influenced by events at meso- and macro-level. At a meso-level it provides an experimentation analysis modelling platform of the development of opponent organization subject to the competitive characteristics of the environment and possible interventions by law enforcement. While our model is theoretically founded on findings in literature and empirical validation is still work in progress, our current model already enables a better understanding of the mechanism leading to social transitions at the macro-level. The potential of this approach is illustrated with computational results.},

  abstract = {Background: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has launched the HIV-1 Human Protein Interaction Database in an effort to catalogue all published interactions between HIV-1 and human proteins. In order to systematically investigate these interactions functionally and dynamically, we have constructed an HIV-1 human protein interaction network. This network was analyzed for important proteins and processes that are specific for the HIV life-cycle. In order to expose viral strategies, network motif analysis was carried out showing reoccurring patterns in virus-host dynamics. Results: Our analyses show that human proteins interacting with HIV form a densely connected and central subnetwork within the total human protein interaction network. The evaluation of this sub-network for connectivity and centrality resulted in a set of proteins essential for the HIV life-cycle. Remarkably, we were able to associate proteins involved in RNA polymerase II transcription with hubs and proteasome formation with bottlenecks. Inferred network motifs show significant over-representation of positive and negative feedback patterns between virus and host. Strikingly, such patterns have never been reported in combined virus-host systems. Conclusions: HIV infection results in a reprioritization of cellular processes reflected by an increase in the relative importance of transcriptional machinery and proteasome formation. We conclude that during the evolution of HIV, some patterns of interaction have been selected for resulting in a system where virus proteins preferably interact with central human proteins for direct control and with proteasomal proteins for indirect control over the cellular processes. Finally, the patterns described by network motifs illustrate how virus and host interact with one another.},

  abstract = {One of the most central questions in network science is: which nodes are most important? Often this question is answered using structural properties such as high connectedness or centrality in the network. However, static structural connectedness does not necessarily translate to dynamical importance. To demonstrate this, we simulate the kinetic Ising spin model on generated networks and one real-world weighted network. The dynamic impact of nodes is assessed by causally intervening on node state probabilities and measuring the effect on the systemic dynamics. The results show that structural features such as network centrality or connectedness are actually poor predictors of the dynamical impact of a node on the rest of the network. A solution is offered in the form of an information theoretical measure named integrated mutual information. The metric is able to accurately predict the dynamically most important node (`driver' node) in networks based on observational data of non-intervened dynamics. We conclude that the driver node(s) in networks are not necessarily the most well-connected or central nodes. Indeed, the common assumption of network structural features being proportional to dynamical importance is false. Consequently, great care should be taken when deriving dynamical importance from network data alone. These results highlight the need for novel inference methods that take both structure and dynamics into account.},

This target article attempts to articulate and support the dynamical hypothesis. The dynamical hypothesis has two major components: the nature hypothesis (cognitive agents are dynamical systems) and the knowledge hypothesis (cognitive agents can be understood dynamically). A wide range of objections to this hypothesis can be rebutted. The conclusion is that cognitive systems may well be dynamical systems, and only sustained empirical research in cognitive science will determine the extent to which that is true.},

It is shown that, by rewriting the multivariate Laplace distribution as a scale mixture, we can incorporate spatio-temporal constraints which lead to smooth importance maps that facilitate subsequent interpretation. The posterior of interest is computed using an approximate inference method called expectation propagation and becomes feasible due to fast inversion of a sparse precision matrix. We illustrate the performance of the method on an fMRI dataset acquired while subjects were shown handwritten digits. The obtained models perform competitively in terms of predictive performance and give rise to interpretable importance maps. Estimation of the posterior of interest is shown to be feasible even for very large models with thousands of variables. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In this letter, we explore reconstruction based on a learned hierarchy of features by employing a hierarchical generative model that consists of conditional restricted Boltzmann machines. In an unsupervised phase, we learn a hierarchy of features from data, and in a supervised phase, we learn how brain activity predicts the states of those features. Reconstruction is achieved by sampling from the model, conditioned on brain activity. We show that by using the hierarchical generative model, we can obtain good-quality reconstructions of visual images of handwritten digits presented during an fMRI scanning session.},

I claim there is no `theoretical fix' or `extra ingredient' in nature that can possibly bridge this gap. Instead, the field of conscious phenomena requires a rigorous method and an explicit pragmatics for its exploration and analysis. My proposed approach, inspired by the style of inquiry of phenomenology, I have called neurophenomenol- ogy. It seeks articulations by mutual constraints between phenomena present in experience and the correlative field of phenomena established by the cognitive sciences. It needs to expand into a widening research community in which the method is cultivated further.},

  abstract = {Is reduction always a good scientific strategy? Does it always lead to a gain in information? The very existence of the special sciences above and beyond physics seems to hint no. Previous research has shown that dimension reduction (macroscales) can increase the dependency between elements of a system (a phenomenon called "causal emergence"). However, this has been shown only for specific measures like effective information or integrated information. Here, we provide an umbrella mathematical framework for emergence based on information conversion. Specifically, we show evidence that a macroscale can have more of a certain type of information than its underlying microscale. This is because macroscales can convert information from one type to another. In such cases, reduction to a microscale means the loss of this type of information. We demonstrate this using the well-understood mutual information measure applied to Boolean networks. By using the partial information decomposition, the mutual information can be decomposed into redundant, unique, and synergistic information atoms. Then by introducing a novel measure of the synergy bias of a given decomposition, we are able to show that the synergy component of a Boolean network's mutual information can increase at macroscales. This can occur even when there is no difference in the total mutual information between a macroscale and its underlying microscale, proving information conversion. We relate this broad framework to previous work, compare it to other theories, and argue it complexifies any notion of universal reduction in the sciences, since such reduction would likely lead to a loss of synergistic information in scientific models.},

Although a sophisticated set of measures is available to describe the topology of brain networks, the selection pressures that drive their formation remain largely unknown. Here we consider generative models for the probability of a functional connection (an edge) between two cortical regions (nodes) separated by some Euclidean distance in anatomical space. In particular, we propose a model in which the embedded topology of brain networks emerges from two competing factors: a distance penalty based on the cost of maintaining long-range connections; and a topological term that favors links between regions sharing similar input. We show that, together, these two biologically plausible factors are sufficient to capture an impressive range of topological properties of functional brain networks. Model parameters estimated in one set of functional MRI (fMRI) data on normal volunteers provided a good fit to networks estimated in a second independent sample of fMRI data. Furthermore, slightly detuned model parameters also generated a reasonable simulation of the abnormal properties of brain functional networks in people with schizophrenia. We therefore anticipate that many aspects of brain network organization, in health and disease, may be parsimoniously explained by an economical clustering rule for the probability of functional connectivity between different brain areas.},

Within such networks, highly connected hub regions are assumed to disproportionately influence behavioral output, although this hypothesis has not been systematically evaluated. Previously, by mapping brain-wide expression of the activity-regulated gene c-fos, we identified a network of brain regions co-activated by fear memory. To test the hypothesis that hub regions are more important for network function, here, we simulated node deletion in silico in this behaviorally defined functional network. Removal of high degree nodes produced the greatest network disruption (e.g., reduction in global efficiency). To test these predictions in vivo, we examined the impact of post-training chemogenetic silencing of different network nodes on fear memory consolidation. In a series of independent experiments encompassing 25\% of network nodes (i.e., 21/84 brain regions), we found that node degree accurately predicted observed deficits in memory consolidation, with silencing of highly connected hubs producing the largest impairments.},

In this work, we address the determinants governing misinformation spreading through a thorough quantitative analysis. In particular, we focus on how Facebook users consume information related to two distinct narratives: scientific and conspiracy news. We find that, although consumers of scientific and conspiracy stories present similar consumption patterns with respect to content, cascade dynamics differ. Selective exposure to content is the primary driver of content diffusion and generates the formation of homogeneous clusters, i.e., "echo chambers." Indeed, homogeneity appears to be the primary driver for the diffusion of contents and each echo chamber has its own cascade dynamics. Finally, we introduce a data-driven percolation model mimicking rumor spreading and we show that homogeneity and polarization are the main determinants for predicting cascades' size.},

  abstract = {When the Mersenne Twister made his first appearance in 1997 it was a powerful example of how linear maps on \$\textbackslash mathbf F\_2\$ could be used to generate pseudorandom numbers. In particular, the easiness with which generators with long periods could be defined gave the Mersenne Twister a large following, in spite of the fact that such long periods are not a measure of quality, and they require a large amount of memory. Even at the time of its publication, several defects of the Mersenne Twister were predictable, but they were somewhat obscured by other interesting properties. Today the Mersenne Twister is the default generator in C compilers, the Python language, the Maple mathematical computation system, and in many other environments. Nonetheless, knowledge accumulated in the last \$20\$ years suggests that the Mersenne Twister has, in fact, severe defects, and should never be used as a general-purpose pseudorandom number generator. Many of these results are folklore, or are scattered through very specialized literature. This paper surveys these results for the non-specialist, providing new, simple, understandable examples, and it is intended as a guide for the final user, or for language implementors, so that they can take an informed decision about whether to use the Mersenne Twister or not.},

Typically, it is detected via an order parameter, appropriately defined for each given system's observed emergent patterns. Recent developments in information theory, however, suggest quantifying collective organization in a system- and phenomenon-agnostic way: decomposing the system's thermodynamic entropy density into a localized entropy, that is solely contained in the dynamics at a single location, and a bound entropy, that is stored in space as domains, clusters, excitations, or other emergent structures. As a concrete demonstration, we compute this decomposition and related quantities explicitly for the nearest-neighbor Ising model on the 1D chain, on the Bethe lattice with coordination number k = 3, and on the 2D square lattice, illustrating its generality and the functional insights it gives near and away from phase transitions. In particular, we consider the roles that different spin motifs play (in cluster bulk, cluster edges, and the like) and how these affect the dependencies between spins.},

Imaging studies suggest that individual variations in key dopamine-modulated brain circuits, including circuits involved in reward, memory, executive function, and motivation, contribute to some of the differences in addiction vulnerability. A better understanding of the main circuits affected by chronic drug use and the influence of social stressors, developmental trajectories, and genetic background on these circuits is bound to lead to a better understanding of addiction and to more effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of substance-use disorders.},

Ferrets in which retinal projections are redirected neonatally to the auditory thalamus have visually responsive cells in auditory thalamus and cortex, form a retinotopic map in auditory cortex and have visual receptive field properties in auditory cortex that are typical of cells in visual cortex. Here we report that this cross-modal projection and its representation in auditory cortex can mediate visual behaviour. When light stimuli are presented in the portion of the visual field that is 'seen' only by this projection, 'rewired' ferrets respond as though they perceive the stimuli to be visual rather than auditory. Thus the perceptual modality of a neocortical region is instructed to a significant extent by its extrinsic inputs. In addition, gratings of different spatial frequencies can be discriminated by the rewired pathway, although the grating acuity is lower than that of the normal visual pathway.}

In this approach we apply subspace filtering not to the observed raw data but to a demixed version of these data obtained by ICA. Finite impulse response filters are employed whose vectors are parameters estimated based on signal subspace extraction. ICA allows us to filter independent components. After the noise is removed we reconstruct the enhanced independent components to obtain clean original signals; i.e., we project the data to sensor level. Simulations as well as real application results for EEG-signal noise elimination are included to show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This review outlines the methodological fundamentals of the most frequently used non-parametric time-frequency analysis techniques in biomedicine and their main properties, as well as providing decision aids concerning their applications. METHODS: The short-term Fourier transform (STFT), the Gabor transform (GT), the S-transform (ST), the continuous Morlet wavelet transform (CMWT), and the Hilbert transform (HT) are introduced as linear transforms by using a unified concept of the time-frequency representation which is based on a standardized analytic signal. The Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) serves as an example of the 'quadratic transforms' class. The combination of WVD and GT with the matching pursuit (MP) decomposition and that of the HT with the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) are explained; these belong to the class of signal-adaptive approaches. RESULTS: Similarities between linear transforms are demonstrated and differences with regard to the time-frequency resolution and interference (cross) terms are presented in detail. By means of simulated signals the effects of different time-frequency resolutions of the GT, CMWT, and WVD as well as the resolution-related properties of the interference (cross) terms are shown. The method-inherent drawbacks and their consequences for the application of the time-frequency techniques are demonstrated by instantaneous amplitude, frequency and phase measures and related time-frequency representations (spectrogram, scalogram, time-frequency distribution, phase-locking maps) of measured magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals. CONCLUSIONS: The appropriate selection of a method and its parameter settings will ensure readability of the time-frequency representations and reliability of results. When the time-frequency characteristics of a signal strongly correspond with the time-frequency resolution of the analysis then a method may be considered 'optimal'. The MP-based signal-adaptive approaches are preferred as these provide an appropriate time-frequency resolution for all frequencies while simultaneously reducing interference (cross) terms.},

Causal language is pervasive in the analysis of such systems, especially when insight into their behavior is translated into policy decisions. This is exemplified by economics, but to an increasing extent also by biology, due to the advent of sophisticated tools to identify the genetic basis of many diseases. It is argued here that a regularity notion of causality can only be meaningfully defined for systems with linear interactions among their variables. For the vastly more important class of nonlinear systems, no such notion is likely to exist. This thesis is developed with examples of dynamical systems taken mostly from mathematical biology. It is discussed with particular reference to the problem of causal inference in complex genetic systems, systems for which often only statistical characterizations exist.},

These methods depend on the relationship between maximal upstroke velocity of the action potential (Vmax) and the sodium current (INa), usually defined in terms of the Hodgkin-Huxley model. These relationships were explored using an adaptation of this model to cardiac Purkinje fibers. In general Vmax corresponded to INa, and it could be used to determine the relationship of membrane potential to GNa, and h infinity. The results, however, depended on the method of stimulation of the action potential, and an optimal stimulation method was determined. A commonly used experimental technique called "membrane responsiveness" was shown to distort seriously the properties of steady-state gating inactivation that is supposed to measure. Estimation of the changes in maximal sodium conductance, such as those produced by tetrodotoxin (TTX), would be accurately measured. Some experimental results have indicated a voltage-dependent effect of TTX. Characteristics of the measures of TTX effect under those conditions were illustrated. In summary, calculations with a model of the cardiac Purkinje fiber action potential provide insight into the accuracy of certain experimental methods using maximal upstroke velocity as a measure of INa, and cast doubt on other experimental methods, such as membrane responsiveness.},

  abstract = {The problem of reconstructing nonlinear and complex dynamical systems from measured data or time series is central to many scientific disciplines including physical, biological, computer, and social sciences, as well as engineering and economics. The classic approach to phase-space reconstruction through the methodology of delay-coordinate embedding has been practiced for more than three decades, but the paradigm is effective mostly for low-dimensional dynamical systems. Often, the methodology yields only a topological correspondence of the original system. There are situations in various fields of science and engineering where the systems of interest are complex and high dimensional with many interacting components. A complex system typically exhibits a rich variety of collective dynamics, and it is of great interest to be able to detect, classify, understand, predict, and control the dynamics using data that are becoming increasingly accessible due to the advances of modern information technology. To accomplish these goals, especially prediction and control, an accurate reconstruction of the original system is required. Nonlinear and complex systems identification aims at inferring, from data, the mathematical equations that govern the dynamical evolution and the complex interaction patterns, or topology, among the various components of the system. With successful reconstruction of the system equations and the connecting topology, it may be possible to address challenging and significant problems such as identification of causal relations among the interacting components and detection of hidden nodes. The ``inverse'' problem thus presents a grand challenge, requiring new paradigms beyond the traditional delay-coordinate embedding methodology. The past fifteen years have witnessed rapid development of contemporary complex graph theory with broad applications in interdisciplinary science and engineering. The combination of graph, information, and nonlinear dynamical systems theories with tools from statistical physics, optimization, engineering control, applied mathematics, and scientific computing enables the development of a number of paradigms to address the problem of nonlinear and complex systems reconstruction. In this Review, we describe the recent advances in this forefront and rapidly evolving field, with a focus on compressive sensing based methods. In particular, compressive sensing is a paradigm developed in recent years in applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and nonlinear physics to reconstruct sparse signals using only limited data. It has broad applications ranging from image compression/reconstruction to the analysis of large-scale sensor networks, and it has become a powerful technique to obtain high-fidelity signals for applications where sufficient observations are not available. We will describe in detail how compressive sensing can be exploited to address a diverse array of problems in data based reconstruction of nonlinear and complex networked systems. The problems include identification of chaotic systems and prediction of catastrophic bifurcations, forecasting future attractors of time-varying nonlinear systems, reconstruction of complex networks with oscillatory and evolutionary game dynamics, detection of hidden nodes, identification of chaotic elements in neuronal networks, reconstruction of complex geospatial networks and nodal positioning, and reconstruction of complex spreading networks with binary data. A number of alternative methods, such as those based on system response to external driving, synchronization, and noise-induced dynamical correlation, will also be discussed. Due to the high relevance of network reconstruction to biological sciences, a special section is devoted to a brief survey of the current methods to infer biological networks. Finally, a number of open problems including control and controllability of complex nonlinear dynamical networks are discussed. The methods outlined in this Review are principled on various concepts in complexity science and engineering such as phase transitions, bifurcations, stabilities, and robustness. The methodologies have the potential to significantly improve our ability to understand a variety of complex dynamical systems ranging from gene regulatory systems to social networks toward the ultimate goal of controlling such systems.},

METHODS: The authors review neuroscience literature and clinical studies investigating the role of the GABA system in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. First, a background on the GABA system is provided, including GABA pharmacology and neuroanatomy of GABAergic neurons. Results from basic science schizophrenia animal models and human studies are reviewed. The role of GABA in cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia is then presented, followed by a discussion of GABAergic compounds used in monotherapy or adjunctively in clinical schizophrenia studies. RESULTS: In basic studies, reductions in GABAergic neuronal density and abnormalities in receptors and reuptake sites have been identified in several cortical and subcortical GABA systems. A model has been developed suggesting GABA's role (including GABA-dopamine interactions) in schizophrenia. In several clinical studies, the use of adjunctive GABA agonists was associated with greater improvement in core schizophrenia symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in the GABA neurotransmitter system are found in clinical and basic neuroscience schizophrenia studies as well as animal models and may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The interaction of GABA with other well-characterized neurotransmitter abnormalities remains to be understood. Future studies should elucidate the potential therapeutic role for GABA ligands in schizophrenia treatment.},

AAV2 was clearly distinct from other serotypes in small spreading and neuronal tropism. We did not observe significant differences in viral spread among other serotypes. Regarding the cell tropism, AAV1, 5, 8 and 9 exhibited mostly glial expression for CMV construct. However, when the CaMKII construct was tested, cortical neurons were efficiently transduced ({$>\sptilde$}70\% in layer 3) by all serotypes, suggesting that glial expression obscured neuronal expression for CMV construct. For both SynI and CaMKII constructs, we observed generally high-level expression in large pyramidal cells especially in layer 5, as well as in parvalbumin-positive interneurons. The expression from the CaMKII construct was more uniformly observed in excitatory cells compared with SynI construct.

As dimensionality was dependent on data set size, we determined asymptotic dimensionality as both the number of neurons and number of stimulus image approached infinity. Our final dimensionality estimate was 93 (SD: {$\pm$} 11), indicating that there is basis set of approximately a hundred independent features that characterize the dimensions of neural object space. We believe this is the first estimate of the dimensionality of neural visual representations based on single-cell neurophysiological data. The dimensionality of AIT object representations was much lower than the dimensionality of the stimuli. We suggest that there may be a gradual reduction in the dimensionality of object representations in neural populations going from retina to inferotemporal cortex, as receptive fields become increasingly complex.

  abstract = {Science is not merely the smooth progressive interaction of hypothesis, experiment and theory, although it sometimes has that form. More realistically the scientific study of any given complex phenomenon generates a number of explanations, from a variety of perspectives, that eventually requires synthesis to achieve a deep level of insight and understanding. One such synthesis has created the field of out-of-equilibrium statistical physics as applied to the understanding of complex dynamic networks. Over the past forty years the concept of complexity has undergone a metamorphosis. Complexity was originally seen as a consequence of memory in individual particle trajectories, in full agreement with a Hamiltonian picture of microscopic dynamics and, in principle, macroscopic dynamics could be derived from the microscopic Hamiltonian picture. The main difficulty in deriving macroscopic dynamics from microscopic dynamics is the need to take into account the actions of a very large number of components. The existence of events such as abrupt jumps, considered by the conventional continuous time random walk approach to describing complexity was never perceived as conflicting with the Hamiltonian view. Herein we review many of the reasons why this traditional Hamiltonian view of complexity is unsatisfactory. We show that as a result of technological advances, which make the observation of single elementary events possible, the definition of complexity has shifted from the conventional memory concept towards the action of non-Poisson renewal events. We show that the observation of crucial processes, such as the intermittent fluorescence of blinking quantum dots as well as the brain's response to music, as monitored by a set of electrodes attached to the scalp, has forced investigators to go beyond the traditional concept of complexity and to establish closer contact with the nascent field of complex networks. Complex networks form one of the most challenging areas of modern research overarching all of the traditional scientific disciplines. The transportation networks of planes, highways and railroads; the economic networks of global finance and stock markets; the social networks of terrorism, governments, businesses and churches; the physical networks of telephones, the Internet, earthquakes and global warming and the biological networks of gene regulation, the human body, clusters of neurons and food webs, share a number of apparently universal properties as the networks become increasingly complex. Ubiquitous aspects of such complex networks are the appearance of non-stationary and non-ergodic statistical processes and inverse power-law statistical distributions. Herein we review the traditional dynamical and phase-space methods for modeling such networks as their complexity increases and focus on the limitations of these procedures in explaining complex networks. Of course we will not be able to review the entire nascent field of network science, so we limit ourselves to a review of how certain complexity barriers have been surmounted using newly applied theoretical concepts such as aging, renewal, non-ergodic statistics and the fractional calculus. One emphasis of this review is information transport between complex networks, which requires a fundamental change in perception that we express as a transition from the familiar stochastic resonance to the new concept of complexity matching.},

  abstract = {The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in neurons integrates a variety of extracellular signals to produce appropriate translational responses. mTOR signaling is hyperactive in neurological syndromes in both humans and mouse models that are characterized by epilepsy, autism, and cognitive disturbances. In addition, rapamycin, a clinically important immunosuppressant, is a specific and potent inhibitor of mTOR signaling. While mTOR is known to regulate growth and synaptic plasticity of glutamatergic neurons, its effects on basic parameters of synaptic transmission are less well studied, and its role in regulating GABAergic transmission is unexplored. We therefore performed an electrophysiological and morphological comparison of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in which mTOR signaling was either increased by loss of the repressor Pten or decreased by treatment with rapamycin. We found that hyperactive mTOR signaling increased evoked synaptic responses in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons by {$\sim$}50\%, due to an increase in the number of synaptic vesicles available for release, the number of synapses formed, and the miniature event size. Prolonged (72 h) rapamycin treatment prevented these abnormalities and also decreased synaptic transmission in wild-type glutamatergic, but not GABAergic, neurons. Further analyses suggested that hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway also impairs presynaptic function, possibly by interfering with vesicle fusion. Despite this presynaptic impairment, the net effect of Pten loss is enhanced synaptic transmission in both GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, which has numerous implications, depending on where in the brain mutations of an mTOR suppressor gene occur.},

  abstract = {The ability to segment continuous linguistic information online into larger, meaningful units is a key element in narrative comprehension. Narrative shifts, i.e. transitions between individual units, are postulated to continuously update the mental situation model. Their cerebral correlates, however, have hardly been investigated. Under highly naturalistic conditions this study seeks to identify the neural correlates of implicit processing of narrative shifts during continuous speech comprehension. 16 male native German speakers listened passively to a German novella for 23~min while BOLD signal was recorded with fMRI. Text comprehension was tested in a short post-scan interview asking for critical episodes of the story. Narrative shifts were defined on the basis of a macropropositional analysis. Compared to listening to text passages of the narrative that neither contained narrative shifts nor structurally similar linguistic control events (i.e., sentence boundaries), narrative shifts evoked increased BOLD signal changes in the right temporal gyrus, precuneus and posterior/middle cingulate cortex bilaterally. When narrative shifts were contrasted with sentence boundaries, activation in the right precuneus and cingulate cortex remained significant. The results strengthen the relevance of medial parietal structures for natural language comprehension. More precisely, the precuneus and posterior cingulate appear to be the neural substrate for updating mental story representations and can be regarded as critical parts of a more complex, distributed neural network underlying story comprehension. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Analysis of information transfer has found rapid adoption in neuroscience, where a highly dynamic transfer of information continuously runs on top of the brain's slowly-changing anatomical connectivity. Measuring such transfer is crucial to understanding how flexible information routing and processing give rise to higher cognitive function. Directed Information Measures in Neuroscience reviews recent developments of concepts and tools for measuring information transfer, their application to neurophysiological recordings and analysis of interactions. Written by the most active researchers in the field the book discusses the state of the art, future prospects and challenges on the way to an efficient assessment of neuronal information transfer. Highlights include the theoretical quantification and practical estimation of information transfer, description of transfer locally in space and time, multivariate directed measures, information decomposition among a set of stimulus/responses variables and the relation between interventional and observational causality. Applications to neural data sets and pointers to open source software highlight the usefulness of these measures in experimental neuroscience. With state-of-the-art mathematical developments, computational techniques and applications to real data sets, this book will be of benefit to all graduate students and researchers interested in detecting and understanding the information transfer between components of complex systems.},

  abstract = {In many neural systems anatomical motifs are present repeatedly, but despite their structural similarity they can serve very different tasks. A prime example for such a motif is the canonical microcircuit of six-layered neo-cortex, which is repeated across cortical areas, and is involved in a number of different tasks (e.g. sensory, cognitive, or motor tasks). This observation has spawned interest in finding a common underlying principle, a `goal function', of information processing implemented in this structure. By definition such a goal function, if universal, cannot be cast in processing-domain specific language (e.g. `edge filtering', `working memory'). Thus, to formulate such a principle, we have to use a domain-independent framework. Information theory offers such a framework. However, while the classical framework of information theory focuses on the relation between one input and one output (Shannon's mutual information), we argue that neural information processing crucially depends on the combination of multiple inputs to create the output of a processor. To account for this, we use a very recent extension of Shannon Information theory, called partial information decomposition (PID). PID allows to quantify the information that several inputs provide individually (unique information), redundantly (shared information) or only jointly (synergistic information) about the output. First, we review the framework of PID. Then we apply it to reevaluate and analyze several earlier proposals of information theoretic neural goal functions (predictive coding, infomax and coherent infomax, efficient coding). We find that PID allows to compare these goal functions in a common framework, and also provides a versatile approach to design new goal functions from first principles. Building on this, we design and analyze a novel goal function, called `coding with synergy', which builds on combining external input and prior knowledge in a synergistic manner. We suggest that this novel goal function may be highly useful in neural information processing.},

Four brief sessions of experimental CBM preceded regular inpatient treatment. In the experimental conditions only, patients' approach bias changed into an avoidance bias for alcohol. This effect generalized to untrained pictures in the task used in the CBM and to an Implicit Association Test, in which alcohol and soft-drink words were categorized with approach and avoidance words. Patients in the experimental conditions showed better treatment outcomes a year later. These findings indicate that a short intervention can change alcoholics' automatic approach bias for alcohol and may improve treatment outcome.},

  abstract = {Coordinated rhythmic movement is specifically structured in humans. Movement at 0\textdegree{} mean relative phase is maximally stable, 180\textdegree{} is less stable, and other coordinations can, but must, be learned. Variations in perceptual ability play a key role in determining the observed stabilities so we investigated whether stable movements can be acquired by improving perceptual ability. We assessed movement stability in Baseline, Post Training, and Retention sessions by having participants use a joystick to coordinate the movement of two dots on a screen at three relative phases. Perceptual ability was also assessed using a two-alternative forced choice task in which participants identified a target phase of 90\textdegree{} in a pair of displays. Participants then trained with progressively harder perceptual discriminations around 90\textdegree{} with feedback. Improved perceptual discrimination of 90\textdegree{} led to improved performance in the movement task at 90\textdegree{} with no training in the movement task. The improvement persisted until Retention without further exposure to either task. A control group's movement stability did not improve. Movement stability is a function of perceptual ability, and information is an integral part of the organization of this dynamical system.},

  abstract = {Our capacity to process and respond behaviourally to multiple incoming stimuli is very limited. To optimize the use of this limited capacity, attentional mechanisms give priority to behaviourally relevant stimuli at the expense of irrelevant distractors. In visual areas, attended stimuli induce enhanced responses and an improved synchronization of rhythmic neuronal activity in the gamma frequency band (40-70 Hz). Both effects probably improve the neuronal signalling of attended stimuli within and among brain areas. Attention also results in improved behavioural performance and shortened reaction times. However, it is not known how reaction times are related to either response strength or gamma-band synchronization in visual areas. Here we show that behavioural response times to a stimulus change can be predicted specifically by the degree of gamma-band synchronization among those neurons in monkey visual area V4 that are activated by the behaviourally relevant stimulus. When there are two visual stimuli and monkeys have to detect a change in one stimulus while ignoring the other, their reactions are fastest when the relevant stimulus induces strong gamma-band synchronization before and after the change in stimulus. This enhanced gamma-band synchronization is also followed by shorter neuronal response latencies on the fast trials. Conversely, the monkeys' reactions are slowest when gamma-band synchronization is high in response to the irrelevant distractor. Thus, enhanced neuronal gamma-band synchronization and shortened neuronal response latencies to an attended stimulus seem to have direct effects on visually triggered behaviour, reflecting an early neuronal correlate of efficient visuo-motor integration.},

Results: The distribution of all CC p-values have a significant cluster of p-values immediately below 0.05, which is indicative of p-hacking. Evidential value (right skewed p-curves) is detected in most meta-analytic topic areas but not motivational interviewing (substance use outcome), sex offender treatment (sexual/general recidivism), police legitimacy (procedural justice), street-level drug law enforcement (total crime), and treatment effectiveness in secure corrections (juvenile recidivism). Conclusions: More studies, especially carefully designed and implemented randomized experiments with sufficiently large sample sizes, are needed before we are able to affirm the presence of evidential value and replicability of studies in all CC topic areas with confidence.},

This interventionist treatment of causal exclusion has in turn been criticized by other philosophers. This paper responds to these criticisms. It describes an interventionist framework for thinking about causal relationships when supervenience relations are present. I contend that this framework helps us to see that standard arguments for causal exclusion involve mistaken assumptions about what it is appropriate to control for or hold fixed in assessing causal claims. The framework also provides a natural way of capturing the idea that properties that supervene on but that are not identical with realizing properties can be causally efficacious}

Because many talents are first identified and nurtured in childhood, it can be difficult to determine whether talent is innate, can be acquired through extensive practice or can only be acquired in the presence of the developing brain. We sought to address some of these issues by studying healthy adults who acquired expertise in adulthood. We focused on the domain of memory and used licensed London taxi drivers as a model system. Taxi drivers have to learn the layout of 25,000 streets in London and the locations of thousands of places of interest, and pass stringent examinations in order to obtain an operating licence. Using neuropsychological assessment and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we addressed a range of key questions: in the context of a fully developed brain and an average IQ, can people acquire expertise to an exceptional level; what are the neural signatures, both structural and functional, associated with the use of expertise; does expertise change the brain compared with unskilled control participants; does it confer any cognitive advantages, and similarly, does it come at a cost to other functions? By studying retired taxi drivers, we also consider what happens to their brains and behaviour when experts stop using their skill. Finally, we discuss how the expertise of taxi drivers might relate to the issue of talent and innate abilities. We suggest that exploring talent and expertise in this manner could have implications for education, rehabilitation of patients with cognitive impairments, understanding individual differences and possibly conditions such as autism where exceptional abilities can be a feature.},

Several longitudinal studies have been conducted (e.g., [9-18]); some involved children or young adults, potentially conflating brain development with learning, most were restricted to the motor domain, and all concerned relatively short timescales (weeks or months). Here, by contrast, we utilized a unique opportunity to study average-IQ adults operating in the real world as they learned, over four years, the complex layout of London's streets while training to become licensed taxi drivers. In those who qualified, acquisition of an internal spatial representation of London was associated with a selective increase in gray matter (GM) volume in their posterior hippocampi and concomitant changes to their memory profile. No structural brain changes were observed in trainees who failed to qualify or control participants. We conclude that specific, enduring, structural brain changes in adult humans can be induced by biologically relevant behaviors engaging higher cognitive functions such as spatial memory, with significance for the "nature versus nurture" debate.},

Old experimental results indicate that repetitive stimulation of the visual pathway evokes synchronous responses at the cortical level with a gain that depends on frequency; oscillations within relevant bands are less damped at subsequent processing levels than others. Our current results show in the cat that cortico-geniculate feedback has a build-in potentiation mechanism that operates at around the beta frequency and activates thalamic cells thus lowering the threshold for visual information transmission. We have also shown that enhanced beta activity is propagated along this feedback pathway solely during attentive visual behavior. This activity consists of 300-1,000 ms bursts that correlate in time with gamma oscillatory events. Beta-bursting activity spreads to all investigated visual centers, including the lateral posterior and pulvinar complex and higher cortical areas. Other supporting data are discussed that are concerned with the enhanced beta activity during attentive-like behavior of various species, including humans. Finally, we put forward a general hypothesis which attributes the appearance of oscillations within the alpha, beta and gamma bands to different activation states of the visual system. According to this hypothesis, alpha activity characterizes idle arousal of the system, while beta bursts shift the system to an attention state that consequently allows for gamma synchronization and perception.},

The study of such multiplex networks is a vibrant area of research. Yet, understanding how to quantify the correlations present between pairs of layers, and more so present in their co-evolution, is lacking. Such methods would enable us to address fundamental questions involving issues such as function, redundancy and potential disruptions. Here we show first how the edge-set of a multiplex network can be used to construct an estimator of a joint probability distribution describing edge existence over all layers. We then adapt an information-theoretic measure of general correlation called the conditional mutual information, which uses the estimated joint probability distribution, to quantify the pairwise correlations present between layers. The pairwise comparisons can also be temporal, allowing us to identify if knowledge of a certain layer can provide additional information about the evolution of another layer. We analyze datasets from three distinct domains---economic, political, and airline networks---to demonstrate how pairwise correlation in structure and dynamical evolution between layers can be identified and show that anomalies can serve as potential indicators of major events such as shocks.},

In this study, using agent-based modelling, we simulate a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic on a homogeneous network. We use transfer entropy and active information storage from information dynamics framework to characterise the critical transition in epidemiological models. Our study shows that both (bias-corrected) transfer entropy and active information storage maximise after the critical threshold (R0 = 1). This is the first step toward an information dynamics approach to epidemics.

As a statistical measure, the permutation entropy describes complexity of a time series or signal measured on a physical system through phase space reconstruction, and takes into account non-linear behavior of the time series, as often seen in vibration signals of rotary machines. Thus it can be served as a viable tool for detecting dynamic changes of the machine working status. The effect of embedded dimension and time delay on calculation of the permutation entropy value has been studied, and the validity of the permutation entropy for detecting dynamic change of a physical system is studied through a well known non-linear system, the Logistic Map. Comparison with other complexity measures using a numerically formulated signal has also been investigated. Experimental results on bearing vibration analysis have then confirmed that the permutation entropy provides an effective measure for monitoring the working status of rolling bearings.},

  abstract = {Non-human primates are valuable for modelling human disorders and for developing therapeutic strategies; however, little work has been reported in establishing transgenic non-human primate models of human diseases. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairment, cognitive deterioration and psychiatric disturbances followed by death within 10-15 years of the onset of the symptoms. HD is caused by the expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG, translated into glutamine) trinucleotide repeats in the first exon of the human huntingtin (HTT) gene. Mutant HTT with expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) is widely expressed in the brain and peripheral tissues, but causes selective neurodegeneration that is most prominent in the striatum and cortex of the brain. Although rodent models of HD have been developed, these models do not satisfactorily parallel the brain changes and behavioural features observed in HD patients. Because of the close physiological, neurological and genetic similarities between humans and higher primates, monkeys can serve as very useful models for understanding human physiology and diseases. Here we report our progress in developing a transgenic model of HD in a rhesus macaque that expresses polyglutamine-expanded HTT. Hallmark features of HD, including nuclear inclusions and neuropil aggregates, were observed in the brains of the HD transgenic monkeys. Additionally, the transgenic monkeys showed important clinical features of HD, including dystonia and chorea. A transgenic HD monkey model may open the way to understanding the underlying biology of HD better, and to the development of potential therapies. Moreover, our data suggest that it will be feasible to generate valuable non-human primate models of HD and possibly other human genetic diseases.},

A thorough literature review in this paper identifies the research gap regarding modeling approaches for assessing human exposure to environment stressors, and it indicates that microsimulation tools are becoming increasingly important in human exposure assessments of urban environments, in which each person is simulated individually and continuously. The paper further describes an agent-based model (ABM) framework that can dynamically simulate human exposure levels, along with their daily activities, in urban areas that are characterized by environmental stresses such as air pollution and heat stress. Within the framework, decision-making processes can be included for each individual based on rule-based behavior in order to achieve goals under changing environmental conditions. The ideas described in this paper are implemented in a free and open source NetLogo platform. A basic modeling scenario of the ABM framework in Hamburg, Germany, demonstrates its utility in various urban environments and individual activity patterns, as well as its portability to other models, programs, and frameworks. The prototype model can potentially be extended to support environmental incidence management through exploring the daily routines of different groups of citizens, and comparing the effectiveness of different strategies. Further research is needed to fully develop an operational version of the model.},

To obtain optogenetic expression across a broad region, here spanning primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices, we used convection-enhanced delivery of the viral vector, with online guidance from MRI. To record neural activity across this region, we used a custom micro-electrocorticographic (??ECoG) array designed to minimally attenuate optical stimuli. Lastly, we demonstrated the use of this interface to measure spatiotemporal responses to optical stimulation across M1 and S1. This interface offers a powerful tool for studying circuit dynamics and connectivity across cortical areas, for long-term studies of neuromodulation and targeted cortical plasticity, and for linking these to behavior.},

However, few studies have been devoted to studying the minimum controlled vertex set through which control over the network with arbitrary structure can be achieved. In this paper, we prove that the minimum driver vertices driven by different inputs are not sufficient to ensure the full control of the network when the associated graph contains the inaccessible strongly connected component which has perfect matching and propose an algorithm to identify a minimum controlled vertex set for network with arbitrary structure using convenient graph and mathematical tools. And the simulation results show that the controllability of network is correlated to the number of inaccessible strongly connected components which have perfect matching and these results promote us to better understand the relationship between the network's structural characteristics and its control.},

The very large number of connections between cortical areas require analysis to be undertaken before reliable conclusions about the organization of neural systems in the cortex can be drawn. We review the methodology and results of two means of analysing central nervous connectivity, hierarchical analysis and optimization analysis. We conclude that these methods are reliable methods for analysing neural connectivity data, and that their results concur. The analyses indicate that all major cortical sensory systems are organized hierarchically, some central sensory systems are divided structurally into several "streams" of processing, the cortical motor system is embedded in the cortical somatosensory system, the frontal and limbic structures are connectionally associated, and that these frontal and limbic areas are invariably associated with the least peripheral sensory processing regions, and are therefore connectionally central. Finally, we discuss the differences on this common plan between the organizations of the cat and primate that these analyses reveal.},

BCI systems extract specific features of brain activity and translate them into control signals that drive an output. Recently, a category of BCIs that are built on the rhythmic activity recorded over the sensorimotor cortex, i.e. the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR), has attracted considerable attention among the BCIs that use noninvasive neural recordings, e.g. electroencephalography (EEG), and have demonstrated the capability of multi-dimensional prosthesis control. This article reviews the current state and future perspectives of SMR-based BCI and its clinical applications, in particular focusing on the EEG SMR. The characteristic features of SMR from the human brain are described and their underlying neural sources are discussed. The functional components of SMR-based BCI, together with its current clinical applications are reviewed. Lastly, limitations of SMR-BCIs and future outlooks are also discussed.},

We represent each agent by an ``endowment vector'' that encapsulates their features and use game-theoretical methods to model the utility of link formation. After applying machine learning methods, we further analyze our model by examining micro- and macro- level properties of social networks as most agent-based models do.

Observers may identify boundaries between events as a result of processing changes in the observed situation. To test this hypothesis and study this potential mechanism, we measured brain activity while participants viewed an extended narrative film. Large transient responses were observed when the activity was segmented, and these responses were mediated by changes in the observed activity, including characters and their interactions, interactions with objects, spatial location, goals, and causes. These results support accounts that propose event segmentation is automatic and depends on processing meaningful changes in the perceived situation; they are the first to show such effects for extended naturalistic human activity.},

Here we collect in detail our strategies for delivering microbial opsin genes to deep mammalian brain structures in vivo, along with protocols for integrating the resulting optical control with compatible readouts (electrophysiological, optical and behavioral). The procedures described here, from initial virus preparation to systems-level functional readout, can be completed within 4-5 weeks.

  abstract = {Understanding structural controllability of a complex network requires to identify a Minimum Input nodes Set (MIS) of the network. Finding an MIS is known to be equivalent to computing a maximum matching of the network, where the unmatched nodes constitute an MIS. However, maximum matching is often not unique for a network, and finding all possible input nodes, the union of all MISs, may provide deep insights to the controllability of the network. Here we present an efficient enumerative algorithm for the problem. The main idea is to modify a maximum matching algorithm to make it efficient for finding all possible input nodes by computing only one MIS. The algorithm can also output a set of substituting nodes for each input node in the MIS, so that any node in the set can replace the latter. We rigorously proved the correctness of the new algorithm and evaluated its performance on synthetic and large real networks. The experimental results showed that the new algorithm ran several orders of magnitude faster than an existing method on large real networks},

  abstract = {Urban safety and security play a crucial role in improving life quality of citizen and the sustainable development of urban. Traditional urban crime research focused on leveraging demographic data, which is insufficient to capture the complexity and dynamics of urban crimes. In the era of big data, we have witnessed advanced ways to collect and integrate fine-grained urban, mobile, and public service data that contains various crime-related sources as well as rich environmental and social information. The availability of big urban data provides unprecedented opportunities, which enable us to conduct advanced urban crime research. Meanwhile, environmental and social crime theories from criminology provide better understandings about the behaviors of offenders and complex patterns of crime in urban. They can not only help bridge the gap from what we have (big urban data) to what we want to understand about urban crime (urban crime analysis); but also guide us to build computational models for crime. In this article, we give an overview to key theories from criminology, summarize crime analysis on urban data, review state-of-the-art algorithms for various types of computational crime tasks and discuss some appealing research directions that can bring the urban crime research into a new frontier.},

  abstract = {The study of recurrent epidemic outbreaks has been attracting great attention for decades, but its underlying mechanism is still under debate. Based on a large number of real data from different cities, we find that besides the seasonal periodic outbreaks of influenza, there are also non-periodic outbreaks, i.e. non-seasonal or non-annual behaviors. To understand how the non-periodicity shows up, we present a network model of SIRS epidemic with both time-dependent infection rate and a small possibility of persistent epidemic seeds, representing the influences from the larger annual variation of environment and the infection generated spontaneously in nature, respectively. Our numerical simulations reveal that the model can reproduce the non-periodic outbreaks of recurrent epidemics with the main features of real influenza data. Further, we find that the recurrent outbreaks of epidemic depend not only on the infection rate but also on the density of susceptible agents, indicating that they are both the necessary conditions for the recurrent epidemic patterns with non-periodicity. A theoretical analysis based on Markov dynamics is presented to explain the numerical results. This finding may be of significance to the control of recurrent epidemics.}

  abstract = {Ketamine, a general anesthetic, has been reported to block sodium channels. Two types of Na(+) channels, tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive (TTX-s) and TTX-resistant (TTX-r), are expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. The present study was to investigate the effects of ketamine on both types, particularly on TTX-r channels, using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in dissociated rat DRG neurons. In addition to confirming ketamine-induced blockage of TTX-s Na(+) current, we showed for the first time that ketamine blocked TTX-r Na(+) channels on small DRG neurons in dose-dependent and use-dependent manner. Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) was 866.2 microM for TTX-r Na(+) channels. TTX-r Na(+) channels were more sensitive to ketamine in inactivated state (IC(50) = 314.8 microM) than in resting state (IC(50) = 866.2 microM). IC(50) was 146.7 microM for TTX-s Na(+) current. Activation and inactivation properties of both TTX-s and TTX-r Na(+) channels were affected by ketamine. Since TTX-r Na(+) channels were preferentially expressed in small DRG neurons known as nociceptors, blockage of TTX-r Na(+) channels by ketamine may result in reducing nociceptive signals conducting to the spinal cord. Moreover, both TTX-r and TTX-s Na(+) channels would be non-selectively blocked by ketamine at high concentration, suggesting that the high dose of ketamine might produce an action of local anesthesia.},

As the structure evolution probability {$\mathsl{H}$} increases, it is found that the resonance undergoes three states: normal resonance, transition state and abnormal resonance. This work reveals significant effects of the coevolution of the topology and the dynamical processes, which even leads to counterintuitive phenomenon. When the coevolution of the topological structure and states of the system is not strong (corresponding to small {$\mathsl{H}$}) a weak external field will lead to a positive feedback. However, if the coevolution is strong enough (corresponding to large {$\mathsl{H}$}) the external field will cause a negative feedback.},

In order to illustrate our approach we analyze in detail how the process of an exponential decay and the process of decoherence can be derived from a collision-like model in which particular collisions are described by SWAP and controlled-NOT interactions, respectively. \textcopyright{} Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005.},

  abstract = {We experience the visual world through a series of saccadic eye movements, each one shifting our gaze to bring objects of interest to the fovea for further processing. Although such movements lead to frequent and substantial displacements of the retinal image, these displacements go unnoticed. It is widely assumed that a primary mechanism underlying this apparent stability is an anticipatory shifting of visual receptive fields (RFs) from their presaccadic to their postsaccadic locations before movement onset. Evidence of this predictive 'remapping' of RFs has been particularly apparent within brain structures involved in gaze control. However, critically absent among that evidence are detailed measurements of visual RFs before movement onset. Here we show that during saccade preparation, rather than remap, RFs of neurons in a prefrontal gaze control area massively converge towards the saccadic target. We mapped the visual RFs of prefrontal neurons during stable fixation and immediately before the onset of eye movements, using multi-electrode recordings in monkeys. Following movements from an initial fixation point to a target, RFs remained stationary in retinocentric space. However, in the period immediately before movement onset, RFs shifted by as much as 18 degrees of visual angle, and converged towards the target location. This convergence resulted in a threefold increase in the proportion of RFs responding to stimuli near the target region. In addition, like in human observers, the population of prefrontal neurons grossly mislocalized presaccadic stimuli as being closer to the target. Our results show that RF shifts do not predict the retinal displacements due to saccades, but instead reflect the overriding perception of target space during eye movements.},

  abstract = {The Granger causality (GC) analysis has been extensively applied to infer causal interactions in dynamical systems arising from economy and finance, physics, bioinformatics, neuroscience, social science, and many other fields. In the presence of potential nonlinearity in these systems, the validity of the GC analysis in general is questionable. To illustrate this, here we first construct minimal nonlinear systems and show that the GC analysis fails to infer causal relations in these systems-it gives rise to all types of incorrect causal directions. In contrast, we show that the time-delayed mutual information (TDMI) analysis is able to successfully identify the direction of interactions underlying these nonlinear systems. We then apply both methods to neuroscience data collected from experiments and demonstrate that the TDMI analysis but not the GC analysis can identify the direction of interactions among neuronal signals. Our work exemplifies inference hazards in the GC analysis in nonlinear systems and suggests that the TDMI analysis can be an appropriate tool in such a case.},

  abstract = {Prediction and control of network dynamics are grand-challenge problems in network science. The lack of understanding of fundamental laws driving the dynamics of networks is among the reasons why many practical problems of great significance remain unsolved for decades. Here we study the dynamics of networks evolving according to preferential attachment (PA), known to approximate well the large-scale growth dynamics of a variety of real networks. We show that this dynamics is Hamiltonian, thus casting the study of complex networks dynamics to the powerful canonical formalism, in which the time evolution of a dynamical system is described by Hamilton's equations. We derive the explicit form of the Hamiltonian that governs network growth in PA. This Hamiltonian turns out to be nearly identical to graph energy in the configuration model, which shows that the ensemble of random graphs generated by PA is nearly identical to the ensemble of random graphs with scale-free degree distributions. In other words, PA generates nothing but random graphs with power-law degree distribution. The extension of the developed canonical formalism for network analysis to richer geometric network models with non-degenerate groups of symmetries may eventually lead to a system of equations describing network dynamics at small scales.},

  author = {Zwart, Teun},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {We study the critical behaviour of the 3-state Potts model in two dimensions and zero-field. Monte Carlo simulations are used to find the critical temperature as well as the critical exponents of the model. These values are calculated by using finite size scaling methods. The Ising model in two dimensions is used as a benchmark for the methods used, given that it is exactly solved. The critical temperature found corresponds well with the exact known value of Onsager's solution. Values of ratios of critical exponents also agree reasonably well when compared to exact results, as do critical exponents themselves. For the Potts model the critical temperature is found to be in moderate correspondence with exact results. Ratios of critical exponents agree well with conjectured results. Using the ratio {$\beta$}/{$\nu$} all critical exponents are in agreement with conjectured results while this is not the case using {$\gamma$}/{$\nu$}, possibly because of finite size scaling corrections. Special attention is paid to scaling for the heat capacity by including a background term.}
